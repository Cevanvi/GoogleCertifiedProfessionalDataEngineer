Hello Cloud Gurus
and welcome to this chapter,
all about Google's Cloud Bigtable.
In this first lecture,
we'll take a high level overview of Bigtable
and explore some of its defining concepts.
So let's start with that high level overview as promised.
Cloud Bigtable is a managed, wide column, NoSQL database.
We'll have a closer look at what this means in a moment,
but a wide column, NoSQL database
can be thought of as a series of key value pairs
where the values are split into columns.
This sets it apart from
the document store style of some other NoSQL databases.
Cloud Bigtable is designed for high throughput
where a typical well-designed workload
can achieve around 10,000 reads or writes per second,
as well as low latency where you can expect responses
in around 6 milliseconds and that's per node.
Bigtable is also designed to scale linearly.
So as a rough guide,
a cluster of 10 nodes could provide 100,000 rows per second
of reads or writes.
Bigtable also provides out of the box high availability
with cross-cluster replication.
Now we'll get more into
the details of Bigtables architecture,
and how to get the most out of its performance
in later lectures.
But this hopefully illustrates
the sheer power of this managed database.
Like many other GCP services,
Bigtable was originally developed internally
to help Google with its own data storage
and retrieval problems.
Most notably for Google Earth,
Google Finance, and Web Indexing for Google Search.
After the internal team spent over 7 person years
designing and building Bigtable internally,
they published a paper detailing its research and design
and presented this at the seventh USENIX symposium
on Operating Systems Design and Implementation in 2006.
But large scale data problems weren't limited
to Google and soon another company read
that research paper and created HBase,
an open-source implementation of the Bigtable model.
That company was Powerset,
who created a natural language search engine for the web.
They're not around anymore, but don't feel bad for them.
Microsoft snapped them up for a cool $100 million.
HBase was then adopted as a top-level Apache project
and became part of the Hadoop Ecosystem
of open source Big Data products.
HBase continues to be actively developed by Apache,
but thanks to it sharing the same conceptual origins
as Bigtable, Cloud Bigtable supports
the Apache HBase library for Java,
making it easy to be interoperable between the 2 systems.
So what does a Bigtable, table, actually look like?
At first glance,
it's tabular nature may make it
look similar to other databases,
but there are some key features which set Bigtable apart.
Every row has a key, which identifies it.
The table is indexed on this key and only this key.
This is the only index you get.
Used wisely, this gives you a tremendous amount of power.
We'll cover ROW KEY design later in this chapter.
Each row can then have several columns,
which can be grouped into families.
Row keys must be strings.
Whereas the value contained in a cell
is just stored as an array of bytes.
Bigtable is a sparse DB,
which means empty cells
don't use any space in your database.
Bigtable is designed to scale to thousands of columns
and billions of rows.
That's right. Billions.
Bigtable scale this well
thanks to some intelligent management of rows
that it does for you, completely under the hood.
Blocks of contiguous rows are sharded
into something Google calls tablets.
These are just big chunks of sorted rows,
which put together form a complete table.
These tablets are what's managed
by nodes in your Bigtable cluster,
not the overall table itself.
Which means workloads can be scaled very easily.
And the tablet data itself
is not even stored on the cluster nodes.
It's kept inside Google Colossus,
their internal global file system,
which again makes it very easy to scale cluster sizes
up and down without having to worry about
using storage on the cluster nodes themselves.
All splitting, merging, and rebalancing
of tablets happens automatically.
Bigtable can even intelligently balance tablets around
cluster nodes for the best possible performance.
So what are some of the best use cases
for this kind of database?
Bigtable works really well for many situations.
It's particularly well-suited
for marketing, financial, and transactional data,
such as transactions and purchase histories, stock prices,
and currency exchange rates.
It's also a natural fit for general Time Series data
or data from internet of things devices,
such as device metrics or sensor data.
As you can see, both of these groups of use cases,
deal with storing large quantities of small pieces of data,
and usually very quickly,
which also makes Bigtable great for streaming analytics.
Bigtable can also work well as a storage engine
for batch MapReduce operations
and machine learning applications.
But as great as all of this is,
it won't suit every application
and Google makes the following recommendations
for possible alternatives to Bigtable.
If you need SQL support
for online transactional processing,
you probably need a traditional SQL database
like Cloud SQL or even Cloud Spanner.
If you need Interactive SQL like Queries for online
analytical processing
and cost efficiency is more important than latency,
you should look into BigQuery.
Google recommend Cloud Firestore
for structured NoSQL documents.
Although arguably you can quite easily transform
such documents into a wide column format
for storage in Bigtable.
However, Bigtable is not hierarchical like Firestore,
and you really only see the cost and performance benefits
in Bigtable, when you're talking about
at least a few terabytes of storage.
Firestore on the other hand,
happily scales from one document upwards.
Google also point out
that for storing simple Key Value pairs,
you should use Cloud Memorystore.
Again, bear in mind the difference between simple key/value
and the value itself being numerous columns
as is the case with Bigtable.
Finally, for real-time applications,
there's Firebase Realtime DB.
Although I don't think anyone would ever
confuse that with Bigtable.
Okay, Cloud Gurus,
that's it for the basic concepts of Bigtable.
If you have any questions,
please feel free to ask me in the course forums.
And if not, I'll see you in the next video.
