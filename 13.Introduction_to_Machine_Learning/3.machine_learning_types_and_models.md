Okay, Cloud Gurus,
in this video, we're going to look
at some of the main machine learning types
and models that are most commonly used.
Let's jump in.
There are 3 common learning types.
There is supervised learning,
unsupervised learning, and reinforcement learning.
There are many other forms of machine learning
in addition to these 3
but these are the most common.
In the case of supervised learning,
we train the model using data that is labeled.
Each example will have a set of features and a label,
that's the correct label.
Machine model will be able to infer the relationship
between the feature values and the label.
In unsupervised learning,
the model is used to uncover structure
within the data set itself.
Reinforcement learning is another type of learning,
which is common in game playing
and other areas of machine learning.
We'll look at all 3 types of learning
in a little more detail in the upcoming slides.
Let's first consider supervised learning.
So in supervised learning, we have training data,
which consists of a set of features,
which we'll call X.
But as I said, with supervised learning,
we always include the correct labels,
these are the Ys.
The features, together with the correct labels,
are used to train our model.
New unseen data,
which consists only of features is then presented
to our model,
and our model will use this training to predict
what the associated labels should be for each example.
This will give us a set of predicted labels, Y prime.
You can think of supervised learning as supervising
or helping the model to learn.
Supervise learning is very much like providing the answers
to tutorial questions,
to help the students do well in the exam
when they're faced with a set of unseen questions,
which do not have answers.
Next, let's consider unsupervised learning.
Again, we have a set of input data.
This time, there are no labels,
we essentially only have a set of features.
The data is fed into our model.
The model provides output.
What the model does is essentially uncover structure
within the input data.
So in this case,
we could have 2 groups or clusters of data,
group A and group B, or cluster A and cluster B.
Examples that fall into the cluster A will be similar
to each other in some way.
An example of using this would be
to uncover personas within your customer data.
And now onto reinforcement learning.
In reinforcement learning,
we have an agent, which is essentially our model.
The agent interacts with an environment.
An example of an environment would be a chess board
as part of a game of chess.
The state of the environment is fed into our model
at time T, at a particular point in time.
Based on the current state that's fed into the agent,
the agent will propose an action at time T.
The action affects the environment
and changes it in some way.
An example of this would be moving a chess piece
from one position to another.
This action will change the state of the environment,
it's no longer the same as it was.
And the new state, the state at T + 1,
is now fed into the agent again.
Most importantly, the agent is rewarded proportionately
to how well the action
that it took at time T affected the environment
in terms of the outcome it wants to get,
such as in terms of winning the game of chess.
AlphaGo Zero uses reinforcement learning
to beat the best Go players in the world.
The outcome of reinforcement learning
is an intelligent agent that can function well
in the given environment.
Now, let's look at a few
of the most common machine learning model types that exist.
The first is regression.
Regression is where we're predicting a real number,
such as the value of a house, Y prime.
We have a regression model,
we pass in a set of features
and the model associates a predicted label,
Y prime, with that set of input features.
So let's take an example where we have 4 bedrooms,
2 bathrooms, and the property is 700 meters squared,
we might get a predicted value of $100,000.
Another property which has 2 bedrooms,
1 bathroom, and is 200 meters squared,
which generally have a lower house price.
And one more example, suppose we have 6 bedrooms,
3 bathrooms, and it's 1,000 meters squared,
it would have a larger value for the price.
It's important to see regression as a model type
because the regression model can be created
in many different ways.
Next, let's look at classification.
Classification is where we predict the class
from a specified set with some probability.
In this case, we associate each input
with a particular class.
So here we have our classification model,
it will take some set of features
and it will associated it with a particular class,
such as class A, with an associated probability,
so this is 98.17% certain that it belongs to class A.
If we look at the same set of features
that we had for our previous example,
for the regression example,
we might associate the first example to class A,
the next example to class B,
and the last example to class B.
Class A could be properties
that are likely to increase in value,
class B could be properties
that are likely to decrease in value.
Again, there are many different ways
to create a classification model.
Let's now look at clustering.
Clustering is where we group elements
into groups or clusters.
So, we have a clustering model, we have inputs,
and we associate some of those inputs with cluster 1,
and other of those inputs with cluster 2,
we can have many, many clusters.
Cluster 1 could be, for example,
employees who exhibit good behavior,
and cluster 2 could be employees
who exhibit naughty behavior.
We can also visualize clustering in a different way.
Imagine we have a set of data points.
We can then associate these with different clusters based
on how similar they are to each other.
In this case, we have 3 clusters,
this is cluster 1, cluster 2 and cluster 3.
Let's take a quick look at the concept of transfer learning,
that we discussed earlier.
As an example, suppose we have a classifier model.
The classifier model has a number of classes,
cat, dog, person, owl, giraffe, and crocodile.
This model is trained using a set of training images.
This allows the model to identify the various types
of animal in photographs, for example.
We can take a copy of this classifier model
and use it to categorize different types of things.
So for example,
suppose we want to identify different types of tree
and we have 4 categories of tree
that we're interested in.
Cedar trees, oak trees, pine trees, and willow trees.
We can use the model, modified slightly
to create a new classifier model
and then, train this new classifier model using a set
of training images.
So there are 3 key points here.
The first is that the new classifier model is based
on the previous classifier model.
The second is that a set
of categories are now completely different.
And the third important point,
is that the number of training images
to train the new classifier model are generally far less
than the number required to train the original model.
This is the key benefits of transfer learning.
Gurus, I hope you found this video interesting.
We covered a lot, I'll see you in the next video.
