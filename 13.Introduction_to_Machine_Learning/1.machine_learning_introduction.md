Well, hello, Cloud Gurus.
In this chapter,
we'll be looking at a really hot topic at the moment,
and that's machine learning.
This chapter provides an overview of the main concepts
and ideas involved in machine learning.
You should understand these well for the exam,
but probably more importantly,
at least I think,
is that you should understand them because
machine learning and artificial intelligence are starting
to play such a significant role in technology
and in society at large.
In this chapter,
we'll start by discussing some of the aspects
of machine learning and artificial capabilities
and how these are structured broadly
within the GTP ecosystem.
We'll then move on to some machine learning basics,
core terminology, and ideas.
We'll then cover some machine learning models.
We'll consider over-fitting,
which is where our models perform well on training data,
but badly on real world examples,
We'll then cover hyperparameters.
And finally, we'll finish off by looking at
feature processing and pre-processing.
So let's get started.
There are 3 concepts you may have heard
quite frequently over the last few months.
These are artificial intelligence,
machine learning, and deep learning.
So let's consider how these are related.
Artificial intelligence is the broadest description
of intelligent machines.
It consists of deterministic and non-deterministic methods
for training machines.
There are two basic types of artificial intelligence.
There's narrow artificial intelligence,
which is focused on very specific tasks,
such as chess or making predictions about
how likely someone is to buy a particular product.
Then there is general artificial intelligence,
which involves teaching machines to behave
very much like humans
and being good at many different tasks.
Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence,
and it's really how we teach or train machines
to act or behave intelligently.
The general idea is that we provide the machine
with lots of data and allow the machine to find
relationships within the data,
and then use those relationships to make predictions
based on new data that it has not yet seen.
Machine learning is the focus of this chapter.
Deep learning is a subset of machine learning.
And as we said, it's a way to train machines.
It involves artificial neural networks,
which are loosely inspired by the structure of our brains.
So brains consist of connected neurons,
which have a cell body, an axon, and a dendrite
which act as connectors between the different neurons,
and this is very similar to the way that
artificial neural networks are structured.
Great progress has been made using neural networks
in computer vision and other areas
of artificial intelligence.
Deep learning has become an area of great interest
to data scientists.
Deep learning will be a focus of a later chapter.
There are three broad ways to engage with
artificial intelligence and machine learning.
The first is to use pre-trained models.
The next is to reuse models that have already been
pre-trained,
but that are adapted to specific situations that
you might face.
And finally, you can build your own models from scratch.
So let's take a look at pre-trained models in more detail.
So with pre-trained models,
you don't need to train the model.
It's trained by someone else, such as Google.
Generally, no knowledge of machine learning is required
because you can interact with the model programmatically,
such as using a REST API.
Moving on to reusable models.
Generally, some model training is required
so you will need your own training data.
However, minimal knowledge of machine learning
is generally required.
This isn't always the case, but generally it's the case.
Relatively small data sets can be used
for training these reusable models.
At the heart of this is something known as
transfer learning.
We're going to transfer learning in more detail
on the chapter on deep neural networks.
And finally, there's the concept of
neural architecture search.
So sometimes when you use something like GCP,
it can search out the best model
to solve a particular problem that you may be facing.
And now let's consider building models from scratch.
So in this case, you need to train the model from scratch,
which generally requires a lot of data.
And to solve real world problems,
you will almost certainly need a deep knowledge
of machine learning.
And as I mentioned, large or very large
data sets are required for training in most cases.
Let's take a look at Google's pre-trained models.
Most of these models are accessible via
REST or RPC APIs.
So firstly, we have the Cloud Vision API.
The Cloud Vision API is able to detect
and label objects within images.
There are millions of predefined categories for the images.
So that means that most common objects will be identifiable.
It's also able to perform facial recognition.
And in addition to this,
it can read printed and handwritten text.
Next, we have the Cloud Video Intelligence API.
Cloud Video Intelligence API is able to identify
a huge number of objects, places, and actions,
which are taking place in videos.
The videos could be streamed or stored in the cloud.
Cloud Translation API allows you to translate
between more than 100 different languages.
It is fast and it is very accurate.
Next, we have Cloud Text-to-Speech API.
Cloud Text-to-Speech API does very much
what it says it does.
It converts text to human-like speech.
Currently there are more than 180 voices available
across more than 30 languages.
Next, we have Cloud Speech-to-Text API,
and surprise, surprise,
Cloud Speech-to-Text API allows you to convert
from audio to text.
The API currently recognizes approximately 120 languages
and variants.
And finally, we have Cloud Natural Language API.
Cloud Natural Language API allows you to perform
sentiment analysis, entity analysis,
entity sentiment analysis, content classification,
and a number of other things.
I hope that gives you some idea of how powerful the
pre-trained models are.
In a later chapter,
we'll be covering the pre-trained APIs in more detail.
So let's look at using reusable models within GCP.
This functionality is provided by Cloud AutoML.
So you would use Cloud AutoML where you need
more specific models.
That is, you need something more specific than the
functionality provided by the pre-trained APIs
we just discussed.
At the heart of AutoML is transfer learning.
So Cloud AutoML allows you to train your own
custom models to solve specific problems.
Cloud AutoML is available in a number of different areas.
So first of all, we have AutoML Vision,
AutoML Video Intelligence, AutoML Natural Language,
AutoML Translation, and finally,
AutoML Tables.
We'll be covering Cloud AutoML in much more detail
in a later chapter.
So Google's AI platform is a platform that really
allows you to train your own models.
It's a platform that supports machine learning projects
right through the entire lifecycle.
So this would be from ideation all the way through
to deployment into production.
AI Platform has a number of capabilities and tools
that allow you to prepare your data
for training your machine learning models,
then to actually build and run those models.
It allows you to manage those models
once they're in production.
And it also allows you to share models with others.
The platform allows you to easily use TensorFlow.
TensorFlow is Google's open source machine learning library.
The platform also gives you easy access to
TensorFlow Extended or TFX.
TensorFlow Extended is an end-to-end platform
for deploying machine learning pipelines.
Of course, the platform gives you access to Google's TPUs
or tensor processing units.
This can speed up the training of your models significantly.
Then there is Kubeflow, Google's open source platform,
which allows you to build machine learning pipelines
that you can easily deploy on premises
as well as in the cloud.
I hope you found the first video in
this chapter interesting.
See you in the next video.
