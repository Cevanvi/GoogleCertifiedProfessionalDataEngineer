Okay, Cloud Gurus,
in this relatively short video,
we'll be covering BigQuery logging and monitoring.
You should always be logging resource events
and monitoring the important ones.
Alerts should be created where a monitored metric
crosses a specified threshold.
Let's take a look.
So in general, you use Stackdriver
to do your BigQuery monitoring.
BigQuery automatically sends the ordered logs
across to Stackdriver.
In fact, many different GCP services do the same thing.
Stackdriver logging will allow you to filter
just for the BigQuery logs.
In Stackdriver, the BigQuery logs can be viewed,
monitored, and visualized.
Within Stackdriver, you are able to create dashboards,
and then you can add charts to the dashboards.
Charts are meaningful visualizations of the logs.
You are able to also create alerts.
This is based on a condition plus a notification type.
The alerts are sent to users
using channels like email, Slack, and text.
There are a number of other channels.
Let's look at the Cloud Audit Logs in more detail.
So Cloud Audit Logs are collections of logs
that are provided by GCP
to allow insights into various services.
BigQuery supports 2 versions of the log messages.
Firstly, there is the AuditData version.
This is the older version.
And then there is the BigQueryAuditMetadata,
and this is the newer version.
The older AuditData log entries
tend to map directly to individual API calls
made against a query.
They are not necessarily well aligned
to BigQuery operations.
That's why you should be using
the BigQueryAuditMetadata version instead.
The BigQueryAuditMetadata logs are not strongly coupled
to particular API calls.
They are much more aligned to the resource itself.
They are much more closely associated
with the state of your BigQuery resources
that can be changed by API calls
as well as by other services and asynchronous tasks.
The audit logs themselves
are divided into 3 different streams.
There is the data access stream,
the system event stream, and the admin activity stream.
The streams are just groupings
for the different types of logs.
So the data access stream provides information
on data access within the query.
The system events stream
provides information on system events.
An example of this would be when a table is deleted.
All remaining activities
fall into the admin activity stream.
Okay, Cloud Gurus,
that's it for BigQuery monitoring and logging.
I'll see you in the next video.
