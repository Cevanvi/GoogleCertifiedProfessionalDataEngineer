Hey, Cloud Gurus. Welcome back.
In this video, we'll be looking at BigQuery ML.
BigQuery ML allows you to do machine learning
in BigQuery using SQL.
This is a really nifty solution.
In this video, we cover BigQuery ML at a high level.
In the Resources section,
I will link to the relevant documentation.
Let's get going.
So how do we access and use BigQuery ML?
Firstly, we can use the web browser.
Secondly, we can use the BQ command line tool.
Thirdly, there is the BigQuery rest API.
And finally, we can use things like Jupyter notebooks,
which would be Cloud Datalab.
And there are a number of other external BI tools.
So what kind of ML models can we create within BigQuery?
Well, firstly, we can do linear regression.
Remember, linear regression
is where we have a number of data points
and we basically fits a line to those data points
so as to minimize the error.
We are also able to do binary logistic regression.
This is where we have 2 classes
and we assign each example to one of the classes.
Thirdly, there is multi-class logistic regression.
This is where we have more than 2 classes
and we assign each example to one of these.
And finally, there is k-means clustering.
This is the most recent addition
to the BigQuery ML models that are supported.
And remember,
k-means clustering is where we have a number of points
and we are able to separate them out
into different clusters.
Let's now take a look
at some of the benefits of BigQuery ML.
Firstly, it's a way of democratizing ML
within your organization.
Far more people within your organization
will now be able to create ML models.
And the reason BigQuery ML democratizes machine learning
is because the models are trained and evaluated using SQL.
BigQuery ML increases the speed and agility
with which you can develop ML models.
BigQuery ML is relatively simple.
BigQuery ML also allows
you to avoid regulatory restrictions.
Because you can develop your ML models directly
in BigQuery you don't need to export your data
to other places in order to analyze it.
Moving data around within the cloud can result
in contravening certain regulatory restrictions,
such as keeping data within a certain region.
Let's now take a look at the BigQuery ML process
at a high level.
So as usual, for all machine learning,
we need to prepare the data.
This data preparation can take place within BigQuery
or it could happen externally and
then that prepared data could be imported into BigQuery.
You would prepare the data directly in BigQuery
by running a number of SQL statements.
Once you've prepared the data,
you'll create and train a model.
This is done in a single step
using the create model statement.
Once you have created and trained the model,
you need to evaluate the model to determine how good it is.
Model evaluation is done using the ML evaluate statement.
Training and evaluating the model is normally
an iterative process.
Once you have trained up a good model,
you can then use it to make predictions.
Predictions are made using the ML predict statement.
It's worth remembering that you pass your training data
into the first step.
You would use test data to evaluate the model.
And finally, you would use unseen observations
on which to make predictions.
Okay, Cloud Gurus, that's it for our video on BigQuery ML.
