Hello Cloud Gurus.
Let's go over some tips to help you with any exam questions
about BigQuery.
My first tip is to understand good organizational design.
You should be able to design systems
that use BigQuery at an organizational and project level.
This includes considerations of how different teams
should be granted different types of access to BigQuery.
And how these decisions also affect cost control.
To dig a little deeper into that,
learn how you would grant access to teams
based on their needs using common IAM roles,
as well as how to use authorized views
to share data across projects.
I'm coming back to cost control.
Make sure that this is a consideration
when designing BigQuery, SQL queries.
Optimization of queries may come up during the exam.
So remember the best practices from this chapter,
such as avoid using SELECT *
and preview and price queries before executing them.
Table design will also be a common exam topic.
Remember that partition tables can reduce costs
and improve query performance when used properly.
Consider clustering to further reduce scans of
unnecessary data.
Now, ideally you should have a working knowledge
of writing optimized SQL statements.
Learning to be an SQL savvy DBA
is unfortunately outside of the remit of this course.
But once you know the basics,
you can pick up some good advice for the exam
by researching SQL best practices and anti-patterns.
And finally,
there aren't really any more snappy tips I can give you
for BigQuery other than
to study this chapter comprehensively
until you're comfortable with the material
and practice, practice, practice with the labs here
and on your own.
Push yourself to experiment with BigQuery and SQL.
This may sound obvious,
but it bears restating as BigQuery features heavily
in the exam.
It's the data warehousing workhorse supporting
plenty of other GCP big data products
in many different scenarios.
So it's definitely one of the main services
you need to be comfortable with before booking that exam.
Okay, Cloud Gurus, that about wraps it up for BigQuery.
Please feel free to reach out to me in the course forums,
if you have any questions.
And if not,
I'll see you next time!
Keep being awesome Cloud Gurus!
