Hey Cloud Gurus.
In this video, we'll be covering
the partitioning and clustering of tables.
We'll start with partitioning.
We'll take a look at what it is and why it is useful.
We'll then go onto clustering,
again, looking at what it is and why it's useful.
And finally, we'll finish off
with some limitations of clustering
and consider some guidelines for querying clustered tables.
Let's get going.
Table partitioning is a way to break up a large table
into a number of smaller tables.
Now partitioning allows the smaller tables
to be created and managed
without having to actually create the tables independently.
The different partitions of a table
are normally stored separately at the physical level.
This allows each partition to be accessed
and maintained independently of the other partitions.
Consider table A. Table A consists of 5 columns.
Here, it is a single table before it has been petitioned.
Now, data is partitioned based on a single column generally,
and this is known as the partition key.
So if we think about how this table would look
once it is broken into partitions,
here, we saying the partitioning is based on column c2,
and we would separate that as into a number of partitions
each one having the same number of columns,
same data structure as the original table.
Partitioning in BigQuery can be done in one of 2 ways.
Firstly, there are ingestion time partitioned tables
and then there are simply partitioned tables.
Let's consider how these 2 forms of partitioning differ.
Let's look at ingestion time partitioned tables first.
These are partitioned by the load or arrival date.
Data is automatically loaded by BigQuery
into the correct date-based partition.
You will have a different partition for each day.
Ingestion time partitioned tables
include a pseudo-column _PARTITIONTIME.
The pseudo-column _PARTITIONTIME
is not part of the schema definition,
but you can and should use this in your queries
with where clauses.
So you want to use the _PARTITIONTIME predicate
to filter the number of partitions
that are scanned in any particular query.
Let's look at partition tables.
In the partition tables,
partitioning is based on a specific column.
This has the format TIMESTAMP or DATE.
You determine which column
should be the partitioning column.
Data is placed into partitions based on the value supplied
in the partitioning column that you identified.
Apart from date-based partitions,
there are 2 additional partitions
that are created for partitioned tables.
These are the NULL and UNPARTITIONED partitions.
The NULL partition represents rows that have a null value
in the partitioned column.
The UNPARTITIONED partition represents data
that is outside of the standard date ranges.
And as with ingestion time partitioned tables,
you should use the partition column specified
in the partition table in your queries.
So remember, data is placed
into the correct partition automatically by BigQuery.
BigQuery also creates the relevant partitions.
You need to declare that a table is a partitioned table
during the creation of that table.
You can also set a partition expiration,
so that only partitions within a certain date range
are retained within BigQuery.
So why use partitioning in BigQuery?
There are two primary reasons.
The first is to improve query performance.
Using partitions means that less data
needs to be read and processed.
And related to this, we have cost controls.
Remember, you pay for all the data
that is processed by a query.
Limiting the data processed by selecting specific partitions
means less is processed and therefore the costs are less.
Let's take a look at clustering.
BigQuery supports clustering over a partitions table.
Clustering is similar to creating an index on a table
and you can use clustering when you have filters
or aggregations against particular columns in your queries.
Table clustering is supported for both types of partitioning
that we discussed previously.
Currently, clustering is not supported
for non-partitioned tables within BigQuery.
When you use clustering and partitioning together,
the data is first partitioned by the partition key
and then clustered based on the cluster key.
So let's look at table A as an example.
Here, we have three partitions.
Column D is the partitioning column.
Suppose we generally access data in table A
by specifying values in 2 columns, column A and column C.
But suppose we specify the column C values
before the column A values.
We can then create a cluster key
using column C and column A.
In clustered tables, the data associated
with a particular cluster key is generally stored together.
Here is an example of an SQL statement that you would use
to create a clustered table.
You'd create the table providing the name,
the partition key,
and then finally, the list of clustered columns.
It's important to remember
that the ordering of the clustered columns
is really important.
That's the order in which you should access the information.
There are a number of limitations
associated with clustered tables.
Firstly, clustering is only supported
for partitioned tables.
Only standard SQL can be used for querying clustered tables.
You can only use standard SQL for writing query results
to a clustered table.
You need to specify the clustering columns
at the time that the table is created.
You cannot change the clustering columns
after the table is created.
Clustering columns cannot be repeated columns.
You are able to specify from one
to four clustering columns for a table.
Let's look at some guidelines for querying clustered tables.
Firstly, you need to filter based on the order
in which the fields were specified
when creating the clustered table.
In this table creation statement, we have clustering,
first, by the customer ID, then by the product ID
and finally, by the order ID.
Querying the table in this way is acceptable.
In the where clause, we have filtering,
first, by the customer ID and then by the product ID.
In this example, we have not used the order ID.
That's not an issue.
This query statement is not good.
In this way clause,
we filter first by the product ID and then by the order ID,
however, we have neglected to include the customer ID,
which was the first field
that we should have used for filtering.
You should avoid using clustered columns
in complex filter expressions.
In your SQL queries,
you should avoid comparing cluster columns to other columns.
Okay, Cloud Gurus,
that's it for partitioning and clustering.
See you in the next video.
