Hey Cloud Gurus.
In this chapter,
we'll be looking at BigQuery.
BigQuery is a really important part
of the GCP Big Data suites,
and you do need to know it well
for the certification test.
In this video,
we'll be covering some of the basics of BigQuery,
and then we'll move on to more advanced topics
in the following videos.
Let's get going.
BigQuery is a Petabyte scale, serverless,
highly-scalable Cloud enterprise data warehouse.
The key takeaway here is that you generally don't need
to worry about the underlying compute network
or storage resources.
It has an in-memory BI engine,
creatively called BigQuery BI Engine.
This allows you to create very fast interactive reports,
and dashboards, and then you can view these in data studio.
It also has machine learning capabilities,
allowing you to build machine learning models using SQL.
There is also support for geospatial, data storage
and processing.
Let's take a look at some of the key features of BigQuery.
It is highly available.
It supports Standard SQL.
Good thing about that is that you can put your SQL skills
to work directly.
BigQuery also handles Federated data,
this is data that is stored outside of BigQuery.
There are some limitations that apply,
we'll cover these later.
There are automatic backups.
There is support for governance and security,
this is critical in today's world,
when there is such a focus on data security
and personal privacy.
There is also separation of storage and compute.
This leads to a number of really positive things,
such as acid compliance, storage operations,
cost-effective scalable storage,
and stateless resilient compute.
So how do you interact with BigQuery?
You can use the web console,
which is available in your web browser.
You can use the command line tool,
specifically the BQ command line tool.
When you install and initialize the Cloud SDK,
you will have this tool included.
BQ is a Python based command line tool for BigQuery.
There are also a number of client libraries
for programmatic access to BigQuery,
and there are libraries for C#, Go, Java,
Node.JS, PHP, Python, and Ruby.
All BigQuery data assets ultimately reside in a project.
Datasets are the containers for tables and views.
You're able to create many datasets within a project.
You can think of a dataset as approximating a database.
Finally, you create each native table,
external table, or view within a specific dataset.
Native tables are standard BigQuery tables
where the data is held within BigQuery storage.
External tables are tables
that are backed by storage outside of BigQuery.
Table schemas are defined within BigQuery,
but the actual data resides outside.
And finally,
views or virtual tables that are created by an SQL Query.
Let's look at how we ingest data into BigQuery.
There are 2 types of data sources for BigQuery:
Real-time data, and in bulk data sources,
such as files.
Real-time events are streamed into BigQuery, generally.
A common pattern is to push the events to Cloud Pub/Sub,
and then use a Cloud Dataflow job
to process them and push them into BigQuery.
Batch sources of bulk loaded into BigQuery.
A common pattern is to push the files to Cloud Storage,
and then have a Cloud Dataflow job, pick that data up,
process it, and push it into BigQuery.
There are 2 SQL Dialects in BigQuery.
Dialects can be thought of as varieties,
so think of that as different ways
to construct queries in BigQuery.
Firstly there's Legacy SQL,
this was the original way of querying BigQuery,
and it was initially called BigQuery SQL.
Now it is a nonstandard dialect,
and Google has recommended
that you migrate queries written using Legacy SQL
to Standard SQL.
Then there is Standard SQL,
this is the preferred dialect.
It is SQL compliance,
and it allows you to efficiently query nested
and repeated data.
The 2 queries are not mutually exclusive,
so you can have different queries
using the different dialects.
As mentioned,
it is recommended that you migrate Legacy SQL queries
to Standard SQL queries, and of course,
it follows that if you are creating new queries,
you should be using a Standard SQL.
So once you have data stored in BigQuery,
what can you do with it?
Well,
you can analyze and visualize the data using BI tools.
These can be external tools like Tableau or Looker,
or you could use Google Data Studio.
You can interactively explore the data using Cloud Datalab.
You can export to Google Sheets or Google Cloud Storage.
You can share the data with colleagues.
You can access the data
from other GCP big data tools
like Dataflow and Dataproc.
It's worth mentioning again how important BigQuery is,
BigQuery occurs in many of the GCP reference architectures.
I suggest you get to know it really well.
Okay, Cloud Gurus,
that is it for BigQuery basics.
See you in the next video.
