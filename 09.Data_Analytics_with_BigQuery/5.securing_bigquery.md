Hello, Cloud Gurus.
In this video, we'll take a look at
how you can secure your BigQuery resources
and how you're also able to manage access
to those resources.
We'll look at the various types of roles,
then we'll cover Cloud DLP.
And finally, we'll cover how your data
is encrypted in BigQuery.
Let's dive in.
Access to data and functionality
is controlled through roles.
There are 3 types of roles relating to BigQuery.
Firstly, there are Primitive roles,
then they are Predefined roles
and finally we have Custom roles.
Primitive roles, are roles defined
at the project level, granting access
at the project level will grant access
to the related project data sets.
Individual data set level access
will overwrite the primitive role access.
And there are three types of primitive roles,
owner, editor, and viewer.
Next let's take a look at the predefined roles.
These grant more granular access
than do the primitive roles.
These roles are defined at the service level.
Unlike the primitive roles,
which we said are defined at the project level.
And finally they are GCP managed.
This means that the privileges associated with the roles
have already been specified by Google.
It is recommended that you use the predefined roles
over the primitive roles.
Finally, they are custom roles.
These are user managed.
That is they're managed by you.
You create the roles and assign privileges to them.
Let's continue looking at roles.
They are a number of different roles
associated with BigQuery.
2 examples would be
the admin role and the data viewer role.
Each role is associated with multiple permissions.
A permission is a very granular level of access
to functionality or data.
Examples of BigQuery permissions
would be the job create permission.
And the data sets creates permission.
Users are associated with roles.
Normally multiple roles.
Groups of users can also be associated with roles.
And of course, users are assigned to groups.
On the right, we have a schematic view
of a project with 2 data sets.
Certain roles are at the project level,
such as the admin role,
which would give access to all data sets
within that project.
Other roles like
the data of your role are specific to a data set.
Let's look at how we handle sensitive data within BigQuery.
Let's start by looking at some examples of sensitive data.
Sensitive data could be payment related information,
such as credit card numbers.
It could be personal medical information.
It could be private identity numbers
such as a social security number.
It could even be people's names
or it be address information.
To make the managing of sensitive data
relatively easy in BigQuery,
GCP provides Cloud Data Loss Prevention or Cloud DLP.
So what does the Cloud DLP API provide?
Cloud DLP is a fully managed service.
It allows you to identify
and protect sensitive data at scale within BigQuery.
It has a large number of predefined detectors to help
identify sensitive information within your data.
Not only does it identify the sensitive information,
but it will also de-identify that data.
This is done using a number of mechanisms.
So how is data encrypted in BigQuery?
Well, we start off with our data and we want it encrypted.
BigQuery encrypts our data
using the DEK or Data Encryption Key.
To ensure the highest levels of security,
the DEK itself needs to be encrypted
to form the Wrapped DEK.
And this is done using the KEK or Key Encryption Key.
This is an independent encryption key,
both the Wrapped DEK
and then encrypted data are stored together.
The Key Encryption Key is stored
within Cloud Key Management Service.
You are able to use your own keys
for data encryption within BigQuery.
Okay Cloud Gurus,
that's it for the video on securing BigQuery.
See you in the next video.
