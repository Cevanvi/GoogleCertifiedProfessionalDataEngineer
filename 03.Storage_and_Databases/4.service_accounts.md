Hello Cloud Gurus,
let's take a little detour on our storage service deep dive
to talk about service accounts.
We touched on security and access control
in our cloud storage video.
Now let's talk about how service accounts
can help us implement better security
for all of our services.
As a quick refresher,
identity and access management in GCP,
is controlled by policies which contain members and roles.
Members in a policy are defined by unique email address.
But this address can belong to an individual,
a Google group that contains many individuals
or a service account,
which is given a unique name
@cloudservices.gserviceaccount.com domain.
Roles then, define a list of permissions
that are assigned to one of these members.
For example, Instance Admin,
which would allow members to administer
all compute engine instances in a project Pub/Sub publisher,
which would allow members to publish messages
to a Pub/Sub topic or storage object viewer,
which would allow read-only access to objects
in cloud storage.
These are just examples.
There are all sorts of different predefined roles
you can assign,
and you can also create custom roles.
Members identified by individual email addresses and groups,
are, of course, human users,
unless we've made first contact with an alien species,
by the time this video is released.
Once a role is assigned to a user,
they still need to authenticate with the platform
in order to use it.
Human users will authenticate with their own credentials.
This might be a username and password
or an OAuth token assigned
through an interactive web session,
but it's tied to the lifecycle of the user,
or at least the user account.
The credentials will be valid as long as the user
is valid in the system.
This makes it a bad idea to use these
for non-human operations.
If you have an automated task
or some level of programmatic access required
by an application,
you could find that access stops functioning
if a user leaves an organization
or has some other security compromise.
The further risk of using human credentials in applications,
is that passwords and keys are more likely
to end up in source code.
To be fair,
this can also be a problem
with non-human service account keys,
but more on that in a moment.
To avoid using human credentials,
we can create a service account.
This is a specific account created for a specific task,
and it can be assigned the granular level of authorization
it needs for the task.
Just the IAM roles required and nothing more.
A service account identity can be assumed
by an application to perform authorized operations.
This is achieved using service account credentials
in the form of keys.
And those keys can be easily rotated.
Well, actually it's non-trivial to rotate keys,
but it's much easier to rotate keys,
belonging to a machine than it is to get a human
to agree to key rotation.
In GCP, there are Google managed service accounts
created by default,
and you can also create your own custom service accounts
or user-managed service accounts.
Every service that runs in GCP,
assumes the identity of a service account.
For example,
compute VMs will run
with the default compute service account.
But for a lot of services,
you can also specify a user-managed service account
to runners.
In this example,
I'm going to start a compute engine VM
running as a service account I've named ingester-app.
Maybe this service account only has access
to specific buckets and Pub/Sub topics.
That means if my application gets compromised,
I've limited the blast radius
of any potential further damage.
If I'd have used the default service account,
the compromised application could have been used
to access any other compute engine VM.
As we mentioned before,
service accounts authenticate
using a service account key.
If it's a Google-managed service account,
like the default compute engine service account,
this happens automatically behind the scenes
and Google manages the key.
For a user-managed service account
that you've created yourself,
you will generate a user-managed key.
The public part of the key remains on the platform
and the private part of the key is downloaded
as a JSON file.
This file can then be used to programmatically authenticate
when impersonating a service account, but be careful.
These key files are extremely powerful credentials.
You could create a service account with admin rights
to your entire project.
And if you then create a key for that account,
and that key is leaked,
well, you've just given away the keys to your kingdom.
As an example of some good practice
for using IAM and service accounts,
let's look at how access control is implemented
for cloud storage.
You can use IAM roles to grant permissions on buckets
in your project, at a project level,
which means all of the buckets in the project are affected.
Again, to do this, you just assign these roles to members.
Those members, like we said,
can be service accounts.
Alternatively,
you could use ACLs to grant granular access
to specific buckets.
In the parlance of ACLs,
you're granting specific permissions to a scope
and a scope is just a set of users.
For most use cases,
Google recommend that you use IAM,
instead of ACLs.
Using IAM,
you can assign any of the following roles
to different members.
Storage object creator will allow you to create objects
in cloud storage,
as well as list projects in an organization.
Storage object viewer will allow you to list
and retrieve objects in cloud storage,
and storage object Admin,
will allow you to perform any action on storage objects.
There's also storage admin,
which adds permissions over buckets, as well as objects.
Creating ACLs is a bit more involved
where a scope involves assigning a permission to a member
for a bucket or an object, or both.
The permissions are,
reader, writer, and owner.
And there's also a default permission for all buckets
and objects.
Assigning reader on a bucket allows you
to list its contents and metadata and read it on an object,
will let you download that specific object.
You can assign writer to a bucket
for full read-write access,
but you can't assign writer to individual objects.
Owner permissions add the ability
to control ACLs for buckets and it's the same for objects.
By default, buckets and objects have a predefined ACL
called project-private assigned to them,
which hands out reader and owner permissions
based on users' IAM roles within a project.
Like I said, ACLs are a bit more involved.
Okay Cloud Gurus,
you should hopefully now have a grasp
on how you can leverage IAM and service accounts
to make your access more automated and more secure.
I definitely recommend you refer to the docs on this one
and don't forget the principle of least privilege.
I'll see you in the next video.
