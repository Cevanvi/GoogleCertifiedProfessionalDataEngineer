Hello, Cloud Gurus.
To help us get data into GCP
the platform has some useful data transfer services
that we could employ.
One of the most useful services
is the Cloud Storage Transfer Service.
This automates the transfer of data from a source to a sync.
The sync is always a Cloud Storage bucket,
but there are a few different supported sources.
These are Amazon S3 buckets, plain old HTTP sources,
and other Google Cloud Storage buckets.
For S3 buckets, you must apply the bucket name
and AWS credentials.
For HTTP sources, you can supply
a tab separated list of URLs and for other GCS buckets,
you just need the bucket name
and the correct IM permissions in place.
Storage transfers can be configured to filter
based on file names and dates, so you can be selective
about which files are transferred from the source.
You can schedule a transfer to take place at a certain date
in the future, as well as perform one right away.
And you can also set up periodic transfers to keep a source
and a sync in, well sync.
You can optionally choose to delete objects
in the destination bucket,
if they don't have a corresponding object in the source.
This is a form of destructive sync,
but can be useful if you absolutely need to make sure
that both ends of the transfer match.
Alternatively, you can also optionally choose to delete
objects in the source once they've been successfully
transferred to the sync.
There are some simple IM roles you can assign
to control access to the storage transfer service.
The storage transfer admin role has full access to list,
create, update, and delete to transfer jobs and operations.
The storage transfer user role can list,
create, and update jobs as well as list,
and pause and resume transfer operations.
And the storage transfer viewer role
can list jobs and operations, but nothing else.
You can also assign the individual permissions
contained within these roles,
if you need to be extra granular with security.
If you're looking to move data directly into BigQuery,
you can also use Google's BigQuery Data Transfer Service.
This can automate the transfer to BigQuery of data
from a number of different sources.
Like with Cloud Storage Transfer Service,
it can be configured to run on a regular scheduled basis.
You can additionally add configurations to backfill
historical data or fill in data that may have been missed
due to a service gap or outage.
BigQuery Transfer Service
has many different supported sources.
Most of them collect marketing analytics and user data.
There are also further sources currently in beta.
The Teradata and Redshift support
are going to be particularly useful when migrating customers
from AWS to GCP.
These currently use a JDBC connection
to each respective, Amazon service.
Finally, if you've got very large volumes of data to move
and you're restricted from moving that data
via the internet, you could use a Google transfer appliance.
This is a physical storage device that you rack
in your data center and connect to your local network.
It's available in 100 terabytes and 480 terabyte versions.
And once you filled it up,
you simply ship the device back to Google.
It will be connected to Google's private network,
and you can control the transfer of data
to its final location, through the Cloud console.
Security is guaranteed during upload transfer and deletion,
meaning it's fully encrypted when you write data
to the appliance in your own network,
as well as when you transfer it inside Google's network.
When you're finished with the appliance,
its disks are erased using NIST standards.
So as I said, this is very useful
when certain industry regulations insist
on the use of physical data transfer.
But it is a slow process.
If your data is not regulated, it's just massive.
You may find that using multiple Cloud VPN links
from your data center can be faster than the 4 physical
1 gigabit links on the back of the appliance itself.
Well, thanks for watching Cloud Gurus
and I'll see you in the next video.
