Hello, Cloud Gurus,
and welcome to this lab:
"Creating a Cloud SQL Instance and Loading Data."
In this lab, we're going to create
a Cloud SQL instance for MySQL.
We're going to connect to our new instance securely
from a compute engine VM using a service account
and the Cloud SQL proxy.
Then we'll load some pre-prepared data and run some queries.
To follow along with this lab, you just need a GCP project
and access to the Cloud console.
You'll also need the MySQL dump file
available in the resources section.
This is some dummy data for a web forum.
It contains two tables, one for authors and one for posts,
and 100 rows of data in each table.
When you're ready, join me in the Cloud console.
So here we are in the Cloud console.
Let's go straight to the burger menu and select Cloud SQL.
If this is your first time using Cloud SQL,
you'll be prompted to enable the API at this stage.
If not, you'll see the instances page,
but, of course, we don't have any instances yet.
So let's create one.
Click Create instance and Choose MySQL.
Choose a name for your instance. Any name will do.
I'll call mine forumdb.
We'll let the console generate
a secure root password for us.
Make a note of this password
or copy it into a text file so you don't lose it.
We'll be using it in a moment.
I'm going to store mine in Google Keep
for the purposes of recording this lab video.
Here we can select the Region for our DB.
Let's keep this as us-central1
and note that we can let GCP
choose the Zone for our instance.
Let's expand the list of configuration options
and see what we have.
So under Connectivity, we can see
that this instance will have a Public IP,
but by default there are no authorized networks.
That means no IP address is whitelisted
to connect to our application.
Let's keep it like that for now.
Under Machine type and storage,
we can change the instance type
which right now is set to db-n1-standard-1
with one virtual CPU
and 3.75 gigabytes of RAM.
In the console, we can helpfully see
how choices we make in this section
will affect the performance of our instance.
Under backups and high availability,
we can set the window when backups are performed
and optionally create a Failover replica.
We won't do this just now to save costs.
And under Maintenance schedule,
we can specify the Maintenance window for our instance.
Okay, let's click Create.
It can take 5 to 10 minutes
for our instance to be provisioned.
While we're waiting, let's create a compute engine VM
that we'll use to connect to MySQL.
We'll go to Compute Engine, VM instances,
and Create a new VM.
You can call this VM whatever you want,
and you can bump it down to a g1-small to save some money.
Let's click Create
and that VM should be up and running in a minute or so.
In the meantime, we'll create a service account
that we'll use to authorize this VM
to connect to the Cloud SQL API.
From the burger menu, select IAM &amp; admin,
and then Service accounts.
Here we can see the default service accounts
for App Engine and Compute Engine.
Click Create Service Account.
It's good practice
to name the service account something descriptive
so we know what it's for.
The data we're going to load in a moment is for a forum,
so let's call this service account forumapp.
You can optionally add a description here as well.
Click Create.
Now we can assign some IAM roles to this service account.
Search for sql and choose Cloud SQL Client.
Then click Continue.
Finally, we need to create a key
that we can use to authenticate
when we impersonate this service account.
Click Create Key and leave the option here as JSON
and a JSON file will be downloaded to your computer.
Don't forget, these files are extremely sensitive
and you don't want them to get into the wrong hands.
Our instance should be up and running now,
so let's go back into Computer Engine
and we'll open an SSH session to our new VM
right inside the Cloud console.
We can upload files from this console as well.
So first, let's upload our JSON key file.
Next, we'll upload the MySQL dump file
that you've downloaded from the resources section.
Let's just check both files are there with ls. Great.
Now we need to install the MySQL Client software.
First, we'll update the local package repos
with sudo apt-get update,
then we'll install MySQL Client package
with sudo apt-get install mysql-client.
And just say yes when prompted to continue.
Now that's done, we need to download
the Cloud SQL Proxy binary from Google.
This piece of software will create
an encrypted end-to-end connection to the Cloud SQL API.
We'll just grab it with wget.
We use -O to give the downloaded file a friendlier name.
Now we need to make the binary executable
with chmod +x ./cloud-sql-proxy.
Before we can run the proxy,
we need to know the connection name for our instance.
So back in the Cloud console,
our database instance should be ready
and we can grab the connection name
from the Instance details page.
Here's the Instance connection name.
Just click this icon to copy that to your clipboard.
Now we can run the proxy by typing
./cloud_sql_proxy -instances=
and then just paste in the name of your instance name.
Then we add =tcp:3306.
That tells the proxy to run a TCP connection on this port.
Then we add -credential_file
to pass in the name of the service account key
we just downloaded.
You should be able to tab complete
the name of your key here.
Finally, we add an &amp; at the end
to keep the command running, but return our command prompt.
This looks quite fiddly,
but normally you'd include this in a startup script
or even in a container.
We should now have a secure connection
to the Cloud SQL API running on our VM,
which means we can connect to our database
as if it's running on local host.
Let's just clear the screen,
grab that root password you made a note of,
and we'll try connecting.
We use the mysql client
u to specify the root user
p to specify we need to enter a password,
and tell it to connect on the local host.
And we're connected. Fantastic.
Let's create a new database called forum.
Now we can exit the MySQL Client
and use the SQL file we just uploaded
to fill our new database with dummy data.
Press the up arrow to retrieve the previous command.
Then just add the name of the database
and we'll send it the SQL file we just uploaded.
Paste in your root password again.
Notice the proxy itself keeps notifying us
of connections opening and closing.
Let's connect again and see how it looks.
We'll use the forum database and see if we have any tables.
Great.
Let's see if we have any rows in our posts table.
Fantastic.
Great job, Cloud Gurus.
You've created a Cloud SQL instance
connected to it securely using a service account
and the Cloud SQL proxy,
imported some data and queried it.
Now you've finished this lab.
Don't forget to delete your Cloud SQL instance
and your Compute Engine VM,
and finally, the Service account you created.
You don't want to leave
service accounts and keys lying around.
Thanks for watching and I'll see you in the next video.
