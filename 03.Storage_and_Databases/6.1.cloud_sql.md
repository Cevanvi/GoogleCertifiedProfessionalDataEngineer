Hello, Cloud gurus.
In this video, we're going to talk about GCP's
managed SQL database service,
imaginably named Cloud SQL.
Before we get into it,
a quick reminder about relational databases.
A relational database contains tables,
which are made up of rows and columns.
What makes it relational is the relationships
between these tables.
In this example, we index an ID
in the customer's and cake's tables.
Then we reference these IDs in our order's table.
This allows us to create powerful relational queries
when we need to look up our data.
But back to Google Cloud SQL.
Here's the GCP Cloud icon for Cloud SQL,
which makes sense as it looks like a stack of tables,
just like you'd find in a SQL database.
If you're coming from the world of AWS,
you could compare Cloud SQL to Amazon RDS.
So what are the top three features of Cloud SQL?
It gives you managed SQL instances.
Note, this isn't a fully managed service,
but it does automate the creation and management
of database instances and databases.
The massive benefit here is that you don't have to
wear you sys admin hat and spend hours setting up servers,
installing software, or worrying about backups and patches.
Cloud SQL comes in two main flavors, MySQL and PostgreSQL
with multiple version support.
At the time of recording,
Microsoft SQL server is also now available in beta.
And Cloud SQL instances are designed
for scalability and reliability.
You can start with the modest configuration
of RAM and CPU and scale it up when required
and back down again.
This is a manual process and can cause
a small service interruption,
but it's still a much smoother process
than migrating to more powerful hardware manually.
In terms of storage, Cloud SQL discs
will automatically grow to meet the demand
of their databases, up to 30 terabytes,
so you'll only ever pay for what you need.
And depending on your database engine,
there are various options available for high availability.
Let's start by taking a closer look at the MySQL offering.
At the time of recording,
this is currently available with the community edition
of either version 5.6 or 5.7.
This is what Google calls it's second generation
of Cloud SQL instances.
There is a first generation that supports MySQL 5.5,
but support for that generation of instances
will expire in January 2020.
Depending on when you're watching this,
that's probably already happened.
You can configure an instance type
with up to 64 virtual CPU cores and 416 gigabytes of RAM.
And as I said earlier, Cloud SQL's storage
can dynamically scale up to 30 terabytes.
Out of the box, Cloud SQL is designed to be secure.
By default, it does not exist
within your project's VBC network.
You have a couple of options
for securely accessing your databases.
You can use the Cloud SQL Proxy,
which is a small piece of software
that creates an end to end encrypted connection
to a database or you can create an SSL/TLS connection
to specify public IP addresses.
Alternatively, you can now create Cloud SQL instances
with private IPs inside your VPC,
which will remove all public access.
There are some further great features of Cloud SQL
for MySQL.
Remember how great I said it was that all this maintenance,
like software patching, is done for you?
Well, the only thing to bear in mind with this
is that you should define a maintenance window
for your instances.
You'll need to choose a day and hour
when your database is likely to be at low utilization.
And GCP will only perform disruptive maintenance
during this window.
This could be to complete the software update, for example,
which might mean restarting the database service.
If you don't choose a maintenance window,
this could happen at any time.
In practice, disruptive changes usually happen
no more often than every three months.
Similarly, Cloud SQL will also take back-ups
of your database.
This is super helpful, and it's great to have it
fully automated, but it may also have a small impact
on performance when back-ups are running.
Restoring an instance from a backup
is also automated for you.
You can initiate this through the console
and restore a backup to the same instance
or to a separate one.
Cloud SQL for MySQL also supports restoring
from a specific point in time,
which can be very helpful.
It's slightly more fiddly though.
You need to make sure that binary logging
is enabled for your instances,
and you have to have continuous binary logs available
since the last full backup.
You will then need to identify the binary log file name
and the position of the event you wish to recover from
by querying bin lock events using the MySQL client.
To make MySQL a managed service,
there are some compromises.
Google can't support 100% of the features available
and still provide a managed service with a good SLA.
Unsupported features of Cloud SQL for MySQL include:
user defined functions, the InnoDB memcached plugin,
MySQL's federated storage engine,
and the SUPER privilege.
This last one is probably the most troublesome,
but it's a constraint
that you're just going to have to work around.
There are also some unsupported statements
in Cloud SQL's MySQL.
These are mostly concerned with plugins
and operations on the local file system,
which is not accessible to the end user.
So let's have a look at the high availability configuration
for Cloud SQL with MySQL.
This works by spanning a region and two zones,
with a primary MySQL instance that replicates
to a failover replica.
The client applications communicates
with the primary instance, either by it's IP address
or a connection with the Cloud SQL proxy.
Now at the unlikely event that there is a zone outage
in GSP, the primary instance will be lost.
However, the IP address and the connection details
are simply transferred to the failover replica
and application may just have to reconnect to the database,
but it won't need to change any configuration to do so.
The failover replica is then promoted to become
the new primary instance.
If there is another healthy zone in the region,
a new failover replica is then created there
and replication continues.
You can also create read replicas in the same zone
as your primary instance.
These are not used for failover
and they access separately from the primary instance,
but they can be useful for providing extra read capacity
to application processes that don't need
to write to the database.
There are a few different options for importing data
into Cloud SQL instances with MySQL.
The easiest method is with a simple MySQL dump
export and import in InnoDB format.
However, this can take quite a long time to complete.
If you're migrating from an existing database,
this is probably going to mean downtime
for any application that relies on that data.
If you have your data available as a CSP file,
you can simply put it in a Cloud storage bucket
and initiate an import from there.
If you want to attempt a live migration
from an existing MySQL database,
you can accomplish this with external replica promotion.
This mean you create a replica in Cloud SQL
that has an external master, you're existing MySQL database.
Once the data is in sync,
you can promote the replica to be a Cloud SQL master.
It can be a fiddly process, however,
and there are quite a few requirements,
including sufficient binary log retention.
Your replica needs to start with an import of a snapshot
of the external data, and this needs to be fully imported
before replication can begin.
Replication will use the binary logging
to catch up with any transactions
after that snapshot was created.
So, you have a window of time to complete this
once you've taken the snapshot,
before you have run out of retained binary logs.
The retention period is usually seven days.
You also need to have GTID consistency enforced
on your external server.
For a full list of requirements,
see the documentation link in the resources section.
Moving on, let's talk about PostgreSQL,
which is the other major database engine
supported by Cloud SQL.
You can run versions 9.6 or 11,
and like with MySQL instances,
you can scale up to 64 cores, 416 gigabytes of RAM
and dynamically can grow storage, up to 30 terabytes.
Connections are the same as MySQL as well.
Either through secure IP white listing,
the Cloud SQL Proxy, or with private IPs in your own VPC.
Also like the MySQL service,
PostgreSQL instances have automated maintenance.
So once again, consider a window where this is convenient.
They also have automated backups
and managed instance restores.
Unfortunately, as at the time of this recording,
right now point in time recovery
is one of the unsupported features of Cloud SQL
for PostgreSQL, along with a few others.
Although the Google product team is always working
on improving things, so this may be added in the future.
Cloud SQL for PostgreSQL does actually support
some PostgreSQL extensions, however,
including data type and language extensions
and PostGIS for spatial objects.
High availability in PostgreSQL
has a different posology from MySQL,
so it's achieved in a slightly different way.
You still have a region and two zones,
but rather than replicating,
we get a primary instance and a standby instance,
which both share the same regional persistent disk.
In the unlikely event of a zonal outage in GCP,
the client connection will be interrupted,
but the shared IP address and connection details
will be moved to the standby instance
to start serving connections.
Unlike the MySQL high availability configuration,
we don't get a new standby instance now.
We assume that at some point the zone can recover
and connections will resume being made
to the primary instance.
So finally, let's talk quickly about importing data
to Cloud SQL PostgreSQL instances.
Right now, you only have two options,
a simple SQL dump and import
or importing a CSV file from Cloud storage.
Sadly, there's no option currently for replicating
or importing from an external PostgreSQL server.
Okay, Cloud gurus, that about wraps it up for Cloud SQL.
I'll see you in the next video.
