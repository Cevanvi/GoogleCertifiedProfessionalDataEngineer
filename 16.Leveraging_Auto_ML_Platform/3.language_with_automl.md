Welcome back Cloud Gurus.
In this video, we'll be looking at
AutoML language capabilities.
Let's get going.
AutoML Natural Language allows you to
create custom models to classify content into a set
of categories that you define.
This would be in the case where the pre-defined categories
are insufficient.
This is a common scenario in business for example,
where you want to categorize feedback that is captured in a
free text field.
In such a case, you almost certainly want to create your own
categories for classification.
In this example, we have the actual feedback on the left
and we have a set of categories that the business
has defined as useful on the right.
AutoML Natural Language allows for the mapping
of this feedback onto your custom categories.
So here we have a contact request,
feedback which is positive,
feedback which is negative, an information request,
a scheduling request, a payment request, and a suggestion.
The process for training and deploying models is
very similar to the process we discussed relating to
AutoML Sight.
Now let's consider AutoML translation.
Here we'll be using a rather contrived example
of a problem you may face.
Suppose you're doing translation with your source language
being English and your target language being French.
We have the English statement, "fill the car with juice."
Using the standard translation API,
that would be translated as,
"Remplir la voiture avec du jus"
which means something like,
"fill the car with fruit juice."
We may be in a context where we want the statement to be
translated differently.
In this case, we would train a specific
translation model using AutoML.
This would allow the translation to happen correctly.
"Remplir la voiture avec de l'essence"
which means "fill the car with petrol."
So AutoML translate is great for helping with domain
specific vocabularies or vernacular speech.
Let's look at the process for working with
AutoML translation.
First of all, training.
You train the AutoML translate model using sets of
source target pairs.
Where the source sentences are in the source language
and the target sentences are in the target language.
You need to ensure that the source target pairs
provided for training cover the translation domain
in which you're interested.
That means that the translation should include examples of
the vocabulary, usage, and grammatical peculiarities that
are specific to your domain.
The ML model can only translate language it has been
exposed to in some form.
If at all possible you should ensure that there is a person
that has a good understanding of both languages involved.
This will ensure that the training data is correct,
and that you end up with accurate translations.
High-quality data is extremely important
for training AutoML Translation.
There can be many challenges when working with
data for translations.
An example of this would be misalignment source
and target sentences in longer text.
So when providing documents for training,
you want the sentences in the source and target documents
to align.
It's easy to get this wrong, especially if you're not
very familiar with the 2 languages.
And there are a number of other similar challenges you may
face when teaching translation models.
And this goes back to the previous point about having the
right people involved.
Okay Gurus, I hope that gave you a sense of how AutoML
can be used to solve domain-specific translation
and language problems.
I'll see you in the next video.
