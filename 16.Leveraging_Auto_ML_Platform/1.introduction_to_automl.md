Hello Cloud Gurus.
All right, in this chapter,
we'll cover the really nifty machine learning functionality
offered by Google in the form of AutoML.
AutoML is used when the fully pre-trained API models
are insufficient for the task at hand
and you need to train a model for your specific problem.
In this chapter, we'll cover the main components of AutoML.
It's a relatively short chapter
because once you have the idea,
it's easy to see how it translates to other areas.
Let's dive in.
AutoML consists of a suite of machine learning products.
AutoML allows people
with limited machine learning experience
to build really high quality models.
AutoML facilitate the training
of custom machine learning models
by people that are not necessarily
very experienced with machine learning.
Cloud AutoML models offer great performance
and high accuracy.
The graphical user interface
makes it easy to train, evaluate, and deploy custom models.
Cloud AutoML provides a great opportunity
to use Google's human labeling service.
This is where a team of people
work to annotate and clean your labels
to ensure that your custom models
are trained on good quality data.
Once you have trained your models,
they are accessible via the AutoML API.
AutoML covers a number of the areas
relating to the AI building blocks
that we've already looked at.
AutoML allows you to easily train custom machine models
in the video, sight, translation, and natural language areas
when pre-trained APIs are not specific enough.
In addition to those areas,
AutoML is also used with structured data.
This capability is known as AutoML tables.
AutoML uses 2 important things
to deliver its powerful capabilities.
First, when you provide data to AutoML
and specify an outcome,
AutoML needs to find a neural network
that is a well suited
to solving the particular problem you are working with.
This is done using
Google's neural architecture search process.
Next, the selected neural network
delivers transfer learning capabilities
whereby it is easily trained to handle novel data.
Remember, transfer learning is where a model developed
for a specific type of machine learning problem
and generally trained on huge amounts of data is modified
in such a way that only a small amount of data
is required for it to learn a new problem.
Okay Cloud Gurus, that's it for the short video,
introducing AutoML.
In the upcoming videos,
we'll go into more detail on the specific areas.
See you in the next video.
