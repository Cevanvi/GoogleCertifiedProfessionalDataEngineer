Welcome back Cloud Gurus.
In this video,
I'll take you through a simple example
of where you'd potentially use AutoML sight capabilities.
Let's get going.
So, AutoML will allow you to train models from label data.
Suppose you are involved with helping a fruit market
become more efficient,
and the owners would like to be able to
automatically distinguish between unripe and ripe bananas
using computer vision.
In this case,
it is unlikely that the standard cloud vision API
will be specific enough to handle this problem.
In this case,
you would need to provide AutoML
with a number of labeled images of ripe and unripe bananas
to train your custom model.
Remember, you can always engage the human labeling service
to have the labeling done efficiently.
So, how does this work?
Well, you provide your images of ripe bananas.
You provide a set of images for unripe bananas.
You feed both of these into the training process,
specifying the outcomes that you want.
A model for training is selected by AutoML,
and this is using the neural architecture search.
Remember, the model is modified
so that it is ready for transfer learning.
And finally, the model is trained on the data.
Let's look at the typical process
used to train models on AutoML.
Firstly, you need to prepare and manage images.
Training images do need to be labeled.
Once your images are labeled,
you need to create a dataset
that will serve as the input to training the model.
A dataset can be single label,
where you assign a single label to each image,
or it can be multi-label,
where you assign more than one label to each image.
At that point, you're ready to start training.
So you train the model using your prepared dataset.
Training can take up to a few hours,
but you are able to check the status throughout.
Each time you run training,
a new model is created.
You'll need to manage these different models,
if you run your training more than once.
Models are evaluated after training
on a test set.
AutoML provides aggregate and detailed information
on the accuracy and quality of your model.
Some metrics provided include
area under the precision recall curve,
confidence threshold curves,
and confusion matrices.
Trained models need to be deployed
before you have the ability
to make online or synchronous predictions.
Once you have the model,
predictions can now be made individually or in bulk.
Individual predictions are done synchronously,
bulk predictions are done asynchronously.
You are able to undeploy your models
when you are either
finished having successfully made your predictions,
or if you have an improved model that you would rather use.
Undeploying models is a good practice
since it ensures your models are being properly managed
and it lowers costs.
Let's talk briefly about AutoML Vision Edge.
AutoML Vision Edge now allows you
to export your custom trained models.
It allows you to train and deploy low latency,
high accuracy models that are optimized for edge devices.
With support for TensorFlow Lite, Core ML,
and container export formats,
AutoML Vision Edge supports a wide variety of devices.
Supported hardware architectures include Edge TPUs,
ARM, and NVIDIA.
You are also able to use the Auto Vision Edge in ML Kit
to build applications on iOS or Android devices.
The solution is available via Firebase.
It offers an end-to-end development environment
for creating and deploying custom models.
Okay Cloud Gurus, that's it for sight with AutoML.
I'll see you in the next video.
