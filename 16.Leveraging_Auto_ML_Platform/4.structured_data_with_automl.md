Hello Cloud Gurus. In this video,
we'll be covering AutoML Tables.
AutoML Tables allows you to quickly build
and deploy machine learning models on structured data.
Let's jump in.
So here you can see where AutoML Tables sits relative to
the other AI building blocks.
As mentioned AutoML Tables works with
structured data.
In this case,
structured data would be data that
you can essentially put into a spreadsheet
with well-defined columns and rows.
So let's look at some of AutoML Tables capabilities.
First, we have data support.
AutoML Tables is able to provide you with information on
data that may be missing.
It also provides correlations, cardinality,
and distributions for each of your features.
Next AutoML Tables provides automatic feature engineering.
This means it will normalize
and bucketize your numerical features,
and it will also create one hot encoding and embeddings for
your categorical features.
Additionally,
it also performs basic text processing for your text fields,
and it is able to extract time
and data features from your timestamp data.
AutoML Tables offers a number of capabilities
with respect to model training.
One of the most important of these
is the parallel testing of multiple models.
This is to help find the best model
for your particular situation.
So when we're working with AutoML Tables,
we provide the structure data.
Remember the feature processing is done for us
by AutoML Tables.
This results in processed data where various features
may have been transformed.
Some of the starter is used for training.
A component of this data is used to test the model,
and a number of different models
will be simultaneously trained
using the training data.
Each of the models is evaluated using the test data
and the best model is selected.
This is all handled by AutoML Tables.
Let's finish off by comparing AutoML Tables
and Big Query machine learning.
You would tend to use Big Query machine learning
for more experimental stages within your process.
This is where, for example,
you would be rapidly iterating on
different hypotheses you may have.
At this point, you may still be deciding
on which features you want to include.
AutoML Tables is really good for optimizing
model quality on the other hand.
AutoML Tables also requires time for model optimization.
As we said, it can take up to a few hours to
optimized a model.
AutoML Tables also works really well,
when you have a wide variety of different features.
Okay, Cloud Gurus,
I hope you found this video interesting.
I hope this has given you a sense of how easy it is to use
AutoML Tables with structured data.
