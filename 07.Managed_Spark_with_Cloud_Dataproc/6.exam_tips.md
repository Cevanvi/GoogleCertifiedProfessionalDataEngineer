Hello Cloud Gurus.
Here are my Cloud Dataproc tips to bear in mind
when you take the data engineer exam.
First up is an easy one.
Just know when to choose Dataproc.
A lot of the exam will be questions asking you
to choose the most appropriate GCP product
for the scenario in question.
Now that you know all about Dataproc,
you know it's a great choice for quickly migrating
Hadoop and Spark workloads into Google Cloud Platform.
But make sure you understand
the benefits of Dataproc as well,
as there's no point in migrating to the cloud,
just for the sake of migrating to the cloud.
The biggest benefits of Dataproc
over a self managed Hadoop or Spark cluster
are the ease of scaling, being able to use cloud storage
instead of HDFS, and the connectors to other GCP services
including BigQuery and Bigtable.
Remember the curriculum is designed to test your skills
at designing data systems.
So you should know about the various cluster options
and when to pick them such as standard clusters
versus highly available clusters,
the pros and cons of autoscaling,
and when ephemeral clusters should be used.
If you are tested on this in the exam,
look for clues in the question to help you choose.
You should also try to get to know the open-source
big data ecosystem.
You should be able to recite a one-line description
of each of the tools supported by Cloud Dataproc,
although you don't need to know all of them in depth:
Hadoop, Spark, Zookeeper, Hive, Tez, and Jupyter.
We've already spent quite a long time on Hadoop and Spark
and you should be able to get a feel
for the rest of these technologies,
just by looking at their website's homepages.
And finally, know when to go with the flow.
Despite how great Cloud Dataproc is,
often Cloud Dataflow is the preferred product
for ingesting big data,
in particular for streaming workloads
so you can't always assume Dataproc
is going to be the right choice.
Cloud Dataflow implements the Apache Beam SDK,
so definitely look out for mentions of Beam
in exam questions.
We'll deep dive on Dataflow in the next chapter
of this course.
Okay, that wraps up our chapter on Cloud Dataproc.
Please feel free to reach out to me in the course forum
if you have any questions and if not,
I'll see you next time.
Keep being awesome Cloud Gurus.
