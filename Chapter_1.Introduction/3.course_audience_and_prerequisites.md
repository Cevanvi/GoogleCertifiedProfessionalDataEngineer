Welcome back, Cloud Gurus.
Let's quickly talk about the intended audience
for this course
and the prerequisites you should have
to maximize your learning.
Let's start by asking who should study this course?
Who are the people it's going to help?
It's true to say that anyone with an interest in big data
or machine learning on GCP
can benefit from studying this course.
In terms of careers,
it's going to be of particular help
to data analysts and scientists,
who may need to know how to build data pipelines,
ingest massive amounts of data,
and perform some complex analytics.
Machine learning or artificial intelligence engineers,
who may be looking to create machine learning models
using GCP or leverage the off-the-shelf AI APIs.
DevOps engineers, or SREs,
who may be responsible for managing infrastructure
that has to handle big data pipelines and databases
as, after all,
there aren't many infrastructure stacks these days
that aren't dealing with huge volumes of data.
And systems engineers,
because, really, they're just the same thing.
To get the most out of this course,
there are some prerequisites.
We can't teach you the basics of GCP;
the course is already long enough.
So we'd recommend
that if you're completely brand new to GCP,
you take the introduction to Google Cloud Platform course
right here on A Cloud Guru.
If you've come from one of our other cert courses,
Google's Associate Cloud Engineer
or Professional Cloud Architect,
that's even better,
but they're not required for this course,
so don't worry if you haven't studied them.
If you've spun up VMs in GCP,
handled storage, or run a database,
then you're probably good to go.
On the topic of databases,
we recommend you have some familiarity already
with some SQL and NoSQL databases,
such as MySQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, or Cassandra.
Part of the role of a data engineer
is to choose the correct database product,
so understanding the differences between these
will really help,
although we do also cover that in the course.
To pass the exam,
you will need some additional hands-on database experience.
We'll go into more detail on that in later chapters.
Finally, as an optional recommendation,
we'd point out that there is some light coding
involved in data engineering.
You'll definitely benefit
from brushing up on a bit of Python,
although it's not required to pass the exam.
We've designed the outcomes from completing this course
to match the published outcomes
of passing the GCP Data Engineer exam.
You will be a competent data engineer
who can design data processing systems
then build and operationalize them
and do the same thing for machine learning models,
all the while ensuring solution quality.
Of course, the dream is that you will then pass
the Google Cloud Certified Professional Data Engineer exam,
and you'll be able to proudly display
this valuable and much coveted badge.
But a course like this can't teach you to pass an exam;
that would be wrong.
Google's exams are designed to test your competency
in a particular field,
and this course will teach you
to be a competent data engineer.
If you study this course
and get lots of practice with our labs,
you should pass first time.
Okay, Cloud Gurus, if you're still watching,
then this is definitely the course for you.
I'll see you in the next video.
