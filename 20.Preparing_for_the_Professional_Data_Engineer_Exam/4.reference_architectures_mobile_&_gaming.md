Hello Cloud Gurus.
In this video, we'll finish our discussion
of Google's official published reference architectures
by looking at solutions
for mobile and gaming systems.
So, back on the GCP Solutions website,
we'll jump to gaming
under the app development section.
First, let's take a look
at the backend database solution.
This is a common pattern
for providing cloud-based data storage
for a distributed, multiplayer online gaming.
But it also features a few components
that we haven't seen a lot of during this course,
like Memory Store and Spanner
so it's also a good refresher on those.
Outside of our data platform,
we have our actual clients.
These could be mobile or desktop games.
Then we have a combination of front-end platform
and dedicated game servers.
These are most likely running
in Google Kubernetes Engine.
Perhaps using the Agones multiplayer server platform
for Kubernetes.
Our game interacts with GCP in several ways.
Our player database is stored in Cloud Firestore.
As a fast, scalable document store,
this is a perfect place
to handle player profiles and authentication.
Now let's say our game relies
on a large, relational database,
but it needs to be available and consistent
across multiple regions.
So we implement the main database
in Cloud Spanner.
But we also add caches
to improve our game's response times
and we do this with separate regional instances
of Cloud Memorystore.
Finally, we can create time-series logging of all events
in Cloud Bigtable
and combine this with other events in BigQuery
to form an analytics backend.
This can be queried by our frontend
to aid in customization or monetization
for our user experience.
Exciting stuff.
Okay, let's go back and look at another one.
Gaming analytics.
By now, I'm sure you can take a look
at a solution like this
and immediately see why all the pieces are laid out
the way they are.
In fact, I bet can probably give you the requirements
for this solution, and a blank piece of paper,
and you'd draw something very similar
based on everything we've learned so far.
This analytics system
supports both streaming and batch.
To help us authenticate our user,
we've dropped in a custom application
in App Engine.
Messages are then streamed asynchronously
through our old friend: Cloud Pub/Sub.
For batch, we simply load our data
into Cloud Storage.
Cloud Dataflow, as we know,
can support both streaming and batch methods
with the same code.
Our backend data warehouse in this diagram
is of course BigQuery.
And once again, we see how the data can be explored
with different tools
relevant to different user's needs.
Our business analysts
who are used to SQL queries
could interact directly with BigQuery
while our data scientists
can explore the data more programmatically
with Cloud Datalab.
Let's quickly take a look at one more.
This is a slightly similar solution,
but designed for optimizing large-scale analytics.
I won't go over all of the components this time.
But what's different about this solution
is its use of streaming inserts in BigQuery.
As we know, streaming inserts in BigQuery are expensive
and should only be used where appropriate.
Now here, critical events and logs need to be available
for immediate query
so they are streamed directly into BigQuery
rather than written in time windowed batches.
The streams are further optimized
by separating different types of events
into their own tables,
helping to keep the number of inserts per table down,
and improving the performance of queries.
Okay Cloud Gurus,
we'll leave the reference architectures there for now.
This should be enough to get you thinking
more about how all these pieces fit together.
Large parts of the exam focus
on knowing what jigsaw pieces need to go where
in the overall architecture puzzle.
Have another scan over these
and some of the other solutions on this website
before you take the exam.
And in the meantime, keep being awesome Cloud Gurus.
