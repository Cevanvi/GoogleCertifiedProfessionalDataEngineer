Hello, Cloud Gurus.
Congratulations on completing the course.
You've now got the knowledge and skills
to utilize the GCP suite
of big data and machine learning products,
and you're ready to take
the GCP Professional Data Engineer exam.
I hope you found the chapters in this course interesting,
useful, and enjoyable.
In preparation for the exam,
you should revisit all of the exam tips lectures,
and try to redo the hands-on labs for extra practice.
Keep an eye out for changes to the course as well.
I'll be adding new content as the GCP curriculum
slowly changes and evolves.
If there's a part of the course you struggled with,
please let me know in the course forums
and I'll do my best to help you out.
The course forums are also a great place
to talk to other budding data engineers
about the concepts you've learned
and your experiences actually getting your hands-on
with these technologies in the labs.
And don't forget to tell me when you pass that exam.
For now, thanks again for watching
and keep being awesome, Cloud Gurus.
