Hello, Cloud Gurus.
Just to put you completely at ease about taking the exam,
here's a quick video about what to expect.
First, let's look at the logistics of the exam.
The Professional Data Engineer exam
is booked online through the Webassessor website.
When you book your exam,
the Webassessor website
will let you choose a center nearest to you.
Now let's talk about the format of the exam.
To complete the exam, you're given 2 hours.
And in that time you have a total of 50 questions to answer.
These are all multiple choice questions.
For most, you only select a single answer,
but on a handful,
you'll be asked to pick 2 possible answers.
Since the mid-2019 refresh of the exam,
there are no longer any case studies for the exam.
That means none in the exam guide to revise with
and none mentioned during the exam.
All of the information you need to answer a question
will be in the wording of the question itself.
As you go through the exam,
you have the option to mark questions for review.
My advice is to do this on almost every single question
the first time around,
unless you are 100% sure of the answer straight off the bat.
Also, if you're struggling to answer a question,
mark it for review and move on rather than waste time.
In my experience using this method
means you'll complete your first pass in about an hour.
Then click Review All
to go back to the questions a second time,
checking to make sure you're 100% happy with your answers.
Uncheck the questions you're happy with now
as you make your second pass.
Then review one last time for the questions
you were really stuck on.
The exam screen will show you a clock
so you can keep an eye on your time as you do this.
Only click Submit Exam
when you're happy with all of your answers.
After you've submitted your answers,
just when you think it's all over
and you'll finally be put out of your misery,
the exam system will ask you for some feedback.
It's tempting to skip straight past this,
and if you do, that's fine.
But in my experience,
there are occasionally exam questions
which might have seemed a little unfair
or perhaps too vague.
Feel free to comment on any issues like that here.
Then finally at the end of the exam,
you'll be given your provisional result as a PASS or FAIL.
You might find it hard to spot as, for some reason,
it's the least highlighted thing on the page,
but the result will be there if you look for it
and hopefully it will be a pass.
Note that Google don't give you a score
or any other feedback, it's just pass or fail.
The results will then be sent off to Google to double-check,
but you can be pretty confident in this result
as long as the testing center didn't have any concerns
about you breaking the rules of the exam environment.
These rules are provided when you book the exam
and include things like
having no written material in the room with you.
Okay Cloud Gurus,
that's all I can tell you without breaking an NDA,
but now you know what to expect.
Have confidence in yourself,
and I know you can pass that exam.
