Hello Cloud Gurus.
In this video,
we'll continue our discussion
of Google's official published reference architectures
by looking at solutions for Internet of Things systems.
Here on the GCP Solutions website,
we'll jump to Internet of Things
under the app development section.
Let's take a look at the IoT MQTT Bridge solution.
This is a common architecture
that might come up in a few exam questions.
But before we get into it,
let's first break down these acronyms.
I'm sure you've heard of IoT, or Internet of Things.
You may not have heard of MQTT.
This stands for MQ Telemetry Transport,
which is a very lightweight messaging protocol
designed to run where network bandwidth
or processing power is limited.
So it's ideally suited to IoT devices.
IoT devices themselves come in all shapes and sizes.
In this example,
they could be anything from oil rigs
to tractors or wind farms.
In reality,
data is captured by anything from tiny sensors
to collections of sensors on larger devices.
Data is then sent via the MQTT protocol.
Cloud IoT Core is a managed service
that provides a bridge between devices
that can communicate using MQTT
and the rest of Google cloud platform.
Cloud IoT manages device registration and authentication
as well as sending and receiving IoT data.
Data is passed into our data analytics and ML backend
using Cloud Pub/Sub.
Here we see the familiar combination
of Pub/Sub and Cloud Dataflow
providing our complete data pipeline,
ingesting messages from Pub/Sub,
transforming them,
and writing them to Cloud Bigtable and BigQuery.
Data is explored in Cloud Datalab
and presented in Data Studio
to gain insights.
At the same time,
data is used to train ML models with Cloud Machine Learning.
This takes us back to Cloud Dataflow,
where changes to device configs
can be pushed back out through Cloud IoT Core.
This can be achieved using Python's MQTT library
either directly from a pipeline in Cloud Dataflow
or by triggering a cloud function written in Python.
Okay, let's take a look
at one more IoT reference architecture.
This one is for Cloud to Edge ML.
This is a somewhat simplified diagram,
but it shows from a high-level how ML models
can be developed in GCP,
but deployed at the edge.
If you're not familiar with this term,
edge computing basically means computing that takes place
closer to the location where it's needed.
As an example,
consider a mobile user with an application
that needs to compute a prediction with an ML model.
Traditionally, we could achieve this
by making a remote call to a cloud service.
Alternatively,
we can actually run the prediction
on an exported model
on the user's device,
and we call this computing at the edge.
In this example, data from the census of a device,
is streamed into our platform in the usual way,
from Pub/Sub through Cloud Dataflow to BigQuery.
We then use Cloud Machine Learning to train our model
based on the data we have acquired.
Then we package our model up to deploy it
back to our remote device.
This diagram is perhaps a little out of date.
We wouldn't necessarily store a machine learning model
in a container image.
You can export TensorFlow models
as surprisingly small files
and serve them in lots of other ways.
In the final piece of this diagram,
we simply store logs from our devices
to help us monitor our deployed model
and perhaps work on its next iteration.
Okay, Cloud Gurus!
If you're now familiar with the purpose
of Cloud IoT Core,
I think that about covers it for this section.
Join me in the next video
where we'll look at some of the reference architectures
for gaming backends.
