Hello, Cloud Gurus.
In this quick video,
I just wanted to share with you some links
to some further reading and additional tutorials
that you can do to really flex
your new data engineering muscles.
Now don't worry,
in my opinion, these are not necessary
to pass the data engineer exam.
They're just some further deep dives you can go on
should the interest take you.
So let's start with Cloud Data Studio.
We didn't include a Data Studio lab in this course,
because really, for the exam,
you don't need in-depth knowledge of how to use it.
You just need to know what it is
and when it would fit in a solution.
But if you'd like to get hands-on with Data Studio,
check out the link in the resources section
for visualizing GCP billing using BigQuery
and Data Studio.
This is a Medium article from the Google Cloud Community
that shows you a great example of how to quickly set up
a useful and visually appealing dashboard in Data Studio
using a BigQuery data source,
and hopefully your GCP spend isn't as high as this one.
Next up is TensorFlow.
As a powerful framework for machine learning,
TensorFlow is a broad and complex technology.
Thankfully, you don't need to dive too deep into it
for the data engineer exam,
but it won't hurt you to do a few of the more basic
tutorials available in the beginner section
of the TensorFlow website.
Also, you can run the tutorials directly in your browser
using Google Colab, their community-hosted
Jupyter Notebooks platform.
Follow the link in the resources section
to the TensorFlow 2 Quick-Start tutorial,
then feel free to explore some of the ML basics
with Keras tutorials.
Cloud AutoML is another one of those services
that's so powerful and feature rich,
but for the purposes of the exam,
you really only need to know what it's capable of,
rather than having extensive experience.
But if you do want to play with it,
I'd recommend the AutoML Vision API tutorial
that I've linked to in the resources section,
which demonstrates how to create a new model
with your own set of training images,
evaluate the results,
and predict the classification of test images
using AutoML Vision.
And finally, there's some other great courses
available on ACG that I can recommend to continue
your learning.
Again, if your focus is pure data engineering
or just passing that exam,
these are not required material.
They're just my personal recommendations
if any of these things interest you further.
The first one, which I already mentioned
when we were looking at Cloud Datalab
is introduction to Jupyter Notebooks,
taught by Romeo Radanyi.
This is a crash course for beginners,
where you'll learn how to use Jupyter for analytics,
visualization, and even machine learning.
Next up, is applied Machine Learning with BigQuery,
taught by Mike West.
This course is a real deep dive on the machine learning
features of BigQuery,
which we didn't cover in much detail in the course,
because again, it's just not a big factor in the exam.
But if BiqQuery and machine learning are your thing,
definitely check out this course.
And finally, Python for Beginners,
taught by Robin Norwood.
As we've seen throughout the course,
Python is used extensively for data engineering.
So if you want to brush up on your coding,
this is a great short course for you to try.
Links to all of these courses are available
in the resources section of this video.
And that's it for additional resources, Cloud Gurus.
Thanks for watching
and I'll see you next time.
