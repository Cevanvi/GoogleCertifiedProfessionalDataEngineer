Hello, Cloud Gurus.
We're nearly at the end of our journey
through Google's big data and machine learning tools.
But before we finish,
we're going to quickly look at
one of GCP's outlying services, Cloud Dataprep.
This tool may only come up in one exam question
or not at all,
but it's still a good idea
to be aware of what it can do.
So what is Cloud Dataprep?
It's a managed service for exploring,
cleaning and preparing data.
Studies have shown that data analysts
spend a huge portion of their time cleansing
and preparing data for ingestion
into data processing systems.
Dataprep provides them
with a really efficient tool to do this
by visually defining transformations.
Rather than writing pipeline code,
you can operate on a preview of underlying data
in much the same way as you would in a spreadsheet,
building up transformations using visual tools.
Then when you're ready
to operationalize your transformations,
they can be exported to Cloud Dataflow.
Now Cloud Dataprep is quite an interesting product
because it's actually an integrated partner service
from a company called a Trifacta.
It links to your GCP project and datasets,
but it doesn't actually run from inside the Cloud console.
You'll see what I mean when we get onto
our Dataprep lab in a moment.
So let's take a look at
some of the concepts in Cloud Dataprep.
At a high level, we have flows, datasets, and recipes.
A flow is your top level container
for bringing together and organizing datasets,
recipes and transformations into one place.
You can think of a flow
as a mini Dataprep project in itself.
datasets are the collections of data
that you will use in your Dataprep flow.
You can import datasets from your local machine,
from cloud storage or from BigQuery.
And recipes are like sets of instructions
or a sequence of steps
that perform various transformations
on your datasets.
This turns them into new datasets
rather than modifying any of the original data.
Recipe transformations are,
for the most part,
built visually using auto-generated suggestions,
built into Dataprep.
For example,
let's take a column of data called car_make.
In our preview, Dataprep shows us
that this column contains 60 different values,
or categories as it calls them.
It can then give us further details for the column,
with a breakdown on the counts of unique values
and the text patterns it's observed
that we can use to help us make transformations.
We can scroll down to see suggested transformations,
such as creating a new column
that tallies these unique values,
and Dataprep will even preview
what a transformation will look like
before it's added to a recipe.
In this example, we've got 2 columns,
first_name and last_name.
And by selecting both of them,
Dataprep suggests the transformation
of merging them into a new column,
separated by a white space character.
And again, it shows us a preview of that transformation.
We can add this step to our recipe
and any other steps we need
to complete the transformation of our data.
And Dataprep has dozens of transformations available.
You can build these up in the recipe editor,
seeing a visual preview on a proxy of your data
even if the underlying datasets are gigabytes in size.
When you've finished creating your recipes,
you can use the Dataprep automator
to schedule the execution
based on specific timings.
Flows are then executed using Cloud Dataflow.
Okay, Cloud Gurus.
That's enough theory for now.
Join me in the next video
where we'll run a quick Dataprep lab,
just in case it does come up in your exam.
