Hello, Cloud Gurus.
In this video, we're going to explore
Google's fully managed NoSQL document store,
Cloud Firestore.
Just a quick refresher on the main difference
between SQL and NoSQL databases.
When we think of SQL databases,
what we really mean is relational databases
that we normally query with SQL.
Data is stored in tables containing rows and columns.
Entities normally have relationships.
That's the whole point of putting them
in a relational database.
There's a strict schema
that defines how we store data in these tables
and how we can join tables together
to support complex queries.
SQL databases usually have to run
as an instance that scales vertically.
That means you can add more RAM and CPU to an instance
rather than adding more instances to meet demand.
On the other end of the spectrum,
when people think of NoSQL databases,
they often think of JSON document stores.
In reality, this is just 1 kind of NoSQL database.
There are other types too.
But let's stick with this explanation
as Firestore is a document store.
In this style of NoSQL database,
JSON documents are stored hierarchically in collections.
The schema is a lot more flexible
and can very between documents and collections.
Typically, NoSQL databases support more simple queries
than SQL databases.
But because of their nature,
they are much more easy to scale horizontally.
This is what's made open-source NoSQL document stores
like MongoDB and Cassandra so popular.
So let's dig into Google Cloud Firestore,
which is replacing an earlier generation product
called Cloud Datastore.
Here's its service icon,
which I guess looks like a collection of documents,
if you zoomed out really far.
For an AWS comparison,
you may be familiar with DynamoDB.
The top 3 features of Firestore are,
number 1,
it's a fully managed service.
That means from the point of view of the end user,
us, it's serverless.
There are no instances to provision or configure.
Firestore is just a service we consume
inside our GCP projects.
It's fully integrated with other GCP products and services,
as well as the products inside Firebase,
Google's mobile development platform.
That's actually where the name Firestore comes from,
as it started life as a Firebase product
before enveloping Datastore
and deprecating it.
Because of its mobile routes,
Firestore also comes with support for iOS and Android
and is a real-time DB.
That means in those mobile SDKs,
an application can be notified of any changes
to a database in real time.
It even provides support for offline access
to data in mobile clients.
But even if mobile isn't your thing,
Firestore is still a great choice of document store
as it provides, not only horizontal auto-scaling,
but also strong consistency
and ACID transactions.
Firestore is a great choice of prototyping,
but can also automatically scale up
for large production workloads.
Oh, and before we move on,
did you know Datastore the precursor to Firestore
used to be a built-in product
that was part of the original App Engine?
Well, now you do.
So what does the data model in Firestore look like?
Well, as I said,
it's a document store.
A document is just some JSON data.
When you have multiple documents describing the same sorts
of things, you bundle them together in a collection.
Think about this example where we're running
a web based chat service.
We have 2 collections rooms and users.
In our rooms collection,
our documents are the individual chat rooms.
In our users collection,
the documents are the users of our service.
So in this example,
where would be a good place to store chat room messages,
and in what format?
Ideally, we would want each message
to be its own document
so it can contain metadata
and other information.
Well, like I said, Firestore is hierarchical.
So a document in a collection
can contain another collection within it.
Here are messages or documents,
and we have a collection of them inside the document
that is this chat room.
This is called a sub-collection
and you can keep going.
Documents in sub-collections
can contain nested sub-collections themselves.
You can nest data like this
up to a hundred levels deep.
Another feature of the Firestore Data Model is references.
If our chat users are currently in a chat room,
we don't want to embed their documents
into a sub-collection of that room.
They might change rooms,
or they might be in multiple rooms.
Instead,
we could maintain a list in our room document
that contains references to users.
You can think of a reference
as a pointer to another document
somewhere else in the database.
Firestore supports the usual data types
that you will have seen in JSON documents before,
including strings, integers,
booleans, floats, and null
as well as bytes,
a block for data,
date, time, and geographical points,
a tuple of longitude and latitude.
Firestore also supports arrays and maps.
Although you need to think carefully
about when a map should become a document of its own.
And of course,
references to documents,
as we saw in the previous example.
Let's dive a bit deeper into using Firestore
as unlike some of the other services in this chapter,
it's a proprietary database
that you're less likely to have experience with.
To add data to Firestore,
we simply create a new document,
a document needs to have an identifier
so we can either specify a unique identifier
when we create the document
or let Firestore create 1 for us.
We can also update existing documents
by referring to their unique identifier.
Here's a simple illustration in Python,
although you can use the language of your choice,
all the popular ones are supported,
Python is just easier to read in these videos.
Here we create a simple object.
It's called a dictionary in Python or a map in Java,
but it basically just looks like JSON.
It just contains some keys and values.
Then we make a call to our database connection, db
and specify a collection,
crew, and reference a new document
that we'll call jeanluc,
then use set to store the data.
Alternatively,
we can create a new document in the crew collection
without specifying a unique identifier
by just using the add method.
Firestore will create a unique identifier
for us in this case.
We could optionally assign
the return value of this statement to a variable
so we can capture the identifier
for later use.
To update an existing document,
we simply get a reference to the document
using the unique ID,
then use update to set a new key value.
Note that in this case,
we're just updating the key called rank.
All of the data in the document would be unaffected.
Deleting data is just as easy.
Once we have a reference for document,
we can use the delete method
or we can actually delete specific fields in a document,
using the Firestore DELETE_FIELD constant,
rather than just setting values to null.
As we've seen,
we can retrieve a document by using its unique ID,
but we can also retrieve all documents
for a given collection
or perform queries to search for documents
using a WHERE clause.
Let's see some examples.
Here we already have the unique identifier, jeanluc.
So it's easy to retrieve the document.
Then we'll just use some Python magic
to print out the contents of the document.
If we want to retrieve all of the documents in a collection,
we can use the stream method,
how we deal with the results is up to us.
In this example,
it's an iterable collection,
so we can print out each result with a for loop.
Finally, we can define a query with a WHERE clause
to search for specific documents within the stream
of that collection.
Here, we only match documents
with the value of the key rank, is commander.
WHERE clauses can contain simple comparison operators
or the array contains keyword
for searching for values inside an array.
You can also add multiple where clauses to a command,
to form a compound query.
Just a couple more nice features of Firestore
before we finish up.
Firestore automatically creates single-field indexes
for each field in a document,
and each subfield in a map.
In this way,
Firestore is designed to already have an index
for most types of query.
So it can be performance out of the box
without an application developer needing
to worry about index design.
To further tune performance,
you can specify index exemption for certain fields,
such as large strings, arrays, or maps.
Firestore can also suggest composite indexes
where this will help performance.
This happens when you attempt a compound query
with a RANGE clause that doesn't map to an existing index.
Firestore will return an error with the link
to the Firebase console that will generate
a composite index for you.
And finally,
a few details on the real-time updates feature.
You can use the on snapshot method of a document
to specify a custom callback function you have written
in your application.
Your function will then be invoked
on an update to that document and can act on it.
The type of event will also be sent
to your callback function.
So you can use logic to determine how exactly
to handle the event.
Okay Cloud Gurus,
I think you've mastered Cloud Firestore now.
I'll see you in the next video.
