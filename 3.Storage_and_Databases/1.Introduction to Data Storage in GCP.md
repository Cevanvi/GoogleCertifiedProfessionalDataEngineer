Hello Cloud Gurus and welcome to this chapter
where we'll take a look at choosing
and using data storage options in GCP.
There are many different storage and database options in GCP
and as a data engineer,
you're expected to be able to choose the right option
based on a set of technical and nontechnical requirements.
In this lecture, we'll take a quick tour
of some of the options available
and why we might choose them over others.
To help you choose the right option,
we can construct a flow chart
based on some simple questions.
The first question to ask is simply,
is your data structured or unstructured?
By unstructured data, we usually mean binary blobs or files,
such as videos and images.
If you need to store this sort of unstructured data,
it's a simple choice, Google Cloud Storage.
If our data is structured,
it's likely to need some sort of database
and there are plenty to choose from.
To start with, let's ask if the data is for analytics.
Are you going to use this data to analyze trends
or maybe build a machine learning model?
If the answer is yes, then great,
but we've got a couple of different options
to consider next.
Do you need low latency access to a database?
Perhaps you have some time series data
that needs to write thousands,
even millions of rows a second.
If that's the case, you may want to choose Cloud Bigtable.
And if latency isn't an issue
and you just need a big data warehouse,
BigQuery is probably the right choice.
Now there are some other major differences
besides latency here.
Bigtable and BigQuery are both data powerhouses in GCP,
so much so that they'll get their own chapter
in this course each,
but just remember where they are in this decision tree
and it'll all make sense the more you learn about them.
Okay, so say your data is not for analytics.
Is it relational data?
The sort of thing you'd normally see
in a MySQL or Postgres database?
Well GCP has some great choices here,
but how much scale do you need?
Does your application serve multiple global regions?
Does your database need to be accessed
with strong consistency from anywhere in the world?
If that's the case, you should take a look at Cloud Spanner,
a groundbreaking managed service
that promises high availability, consistency,
and horizontal scaling.
If you just need a traditional SQL database,
there are fully managed MySQL and Postgres options
in Cloud SQL.
If your data is not relational, maybe you need mobile SDKs
or maybe you need some sort of NoSQL database.
In this GCP decision tree,
both choices lead you to Cloud Firestore.
This is Google's proprietary NoSQL documents store
with fully managed auto-scaling and offline data access.
It's the new version of Cloud Datastore,
which has merged with its counterpart from Firebase,
Google's mobile developer platform.
Now there's just one more product to add.
This layout comes from Google's own recommendations
of how to choose a data product,
but they leave out Cloud Memorystore.
It's simply a managed Redis service.
So if your application needs a Redis key value
in memory database, there's a managed service just for you.
Okay, Cloud gurus, that's a lot of products to learn about,
but over time, this flowchart will embed itself
in your memory and your decision-making
as we go through each product and its pros and cons.
So let's start with Cloud Storage.
As we stated at the top of our flow chart,
it's ideal for unstructured object storage.
It basically provides you with buckets
where you can store files.
Buckets can exist in a single region,
two regions, or several regions.
All options are durable,
but serving from multiple regions can reduce latency.
Buckets and objects and side buckets can also be classified
as standard, nearline, or coldline.
These are indications of how often the data
is likely to be accessed and allow you to pay less
for data that is infrequently accessed.
One key feature of Cloud Storage when handling data
is the system of storage event triggers.
When an object is written to a Cloud Storage bucket,
you can trigger a notification, which can in turn,
cause some other action to happen.
This is achieved using Google Pub/Sub,
which we'll discuss later in the course.
Triggers from Cloud Storage events
are usually the first steps
in building a data ingestion pipeline.
Next up, is Cloud Bigtable.
This is Google's petabyte-scale wide column NoSQL database
designed for high-throughput and scalability.
When people think of NoSQL,
they often think of document stores like MongoDB,
but Bigtable is designed for wide column, key value data.
Entries have a single key and multiple columns
and the whole system is designed
for very high volume writes,
making it ideally suited to time-series, transactional,
or internet of things data.
BigQuery is Google's other petabyte-scale data platform.
BigQuery is designed to be your big data warehouse,
storing incredible amounts of data,
but in a familiar relational way.
This enables data analysts to query these enormous datasets
with simple SQL statements.
BigQuery can retain historical data for very little cost,
the same as Cloud Storage itself,
so you can use it for analytics
to form the foundations of business intelligence systems
or train machine learning models on its datasets.
There are also multiple public datasets available,
which can be very useful.
Putting analytics to one side for a moment,
let's look at standard relational databases,
although there's nothing standard about Cloud Spanner.
This is Google's global SQL-based relational database.
It's a proprietary product
that provides horizontal scalability
and high availability and strong consistency.
"How is this possible?" You may ask.
"Doesn't this break the CAP theorem?"
Well, sort of, we'll get into this amazing database
later in the chapter,
and don't worry if you've never heard of the CAP theorem,
we cover that as well.
It's not cheap to run,
but if your business needs all 3 of these things,
Spanner could be the answer.
It's in particular traction in the financial sector
where transactions absolutely rely on such features.
If you don't need all the bells and whistles
of Cloud Spanner, or you need to be interoperable
with open source databases, look no further than Cloud SQL.
This provides you with managed instances
of MySQL and Postgres,
which removes the requirement for you to provision
and configure your own virtual machines.
Cloud SQL even has built-in backups, replicas, and failover.
It doesn't scale horizontally but can scale vertically,
which means you can change the size of the instance type
if you need to add more CPU or RAM.
Cloud SQL is now also offering Microsoft SQL Server in beta.
So that's plenty of SQL options, what about NoSQL?
Cloud Firestore is Google's fully-managed
NoSQL document database, designed for large collections
of small JSON documents.
In this way, you can think of it a bit like MongoDB.
Firestore is the new version of Cloud Datastore,
which has been around for a long time
and was actually created originally as part of App Engine.
But Firestore inherits a bunch of features from Firebase,
Google's mobile development platform.
So Firestore also provides a realtime database
with offline caching and mobile SDKs out of the box.
Unlike Datastore before it,
Firestore now also offers strong consistency.
And finally, let's take a look at Cloud Memorystore,
which very simply is a service
that provides managed Redis instances.
Again, the benefit here is that you don't need to provision
and configure your own virtual machines.
Redis is commonly used as an in-memory database,
message cache, or broker.
Memorystore adds built-in high availability,
depending on the service tier you choose
and can also be vertically scaled
by dynamically increasing the amount of RAM
available to your instances.
Okay, Cloud Gurus, for the rest of this chapter,
we'll take a closer look at some of these options.
As I said before, Bigtable and BigQuery
are, well, big topics, so they'll get chapters of their own.
But before we jump into a product deep dive,
join me in the next video
where we'll talk about some fundamentals
of working with data, which will help you
when choosing the right product or service.
