## Lesson Transcript

Hello Cloud Gurus, and welcome to this lab
working with Cloud Memorystore.
In this lab, we're going to create a Twitter clone
to demonstrate how a simple key-value store
can power a full-blown web application,
although it'll only be a super basic version
that allows you to post and view a timeline.
We'll build this application with Python,
although the code is already written,
so don't worry if you're not familiar
with Python as a language.
The main thing here is to see how we interact
with Redis as a service through Memorystore.
All you need for this lab is a GCP project
and access to the cloud console.
We'll use code from a public GitHub repo
at some point during the lab,
and you can find the link to this in the resources section.
When you're ready, join me in the cloud console.
So here in the cloud console,
let's start by selecting Cloud Memorystore
from the burger menu,
then click create instance.
First, we'll give our instance a permanent ID, retwis.
This is the name of the Twitter clone software
we're going to be using.
We can leave everything else as the default.
We'll use version four of Redis
and leave this at the basic service tier
of Memorystore to save costs.
We'll start with one gigabyte of capacity for our instance,
which we can see should support 375 megabits per second
of network throughput, more than enough for us.
Finally, note here that we have to select which VPC
is our authorized network for access to Memorystore.
Default is our only network in this project,
so we leave this as is.
Then click create.
Next, we'll create a Compute Engine VM
to host our application.
Go to Compute Engine in the burger menu and click create.
You can name the VM anything you like.
I'll call mine retwisapp.
We'll leave the default instance type,
but let's change the boot disc to Ubuntu 19.04
so we've got some more up-to-date development tools.
We're also going to add a network tag to this instance.
Open the extra options and go to networking
and add the network tag retwis.
We'll use this tag in a moment to create a firewall rule
so we can access our application.
You can leave everything else as the default,
then click create.
While that's building, let's add that firewall rule.
Under VPC networks, select firewall rules,
then click create firewall rule.
We'll call the rule retwis-access.
We'll add a target tag of retwis
so this firewall rule will apply to our application.
Under source IP ranges, enter 0.0.0.0/0,
which basically means the whole internet.
Under specified protocols and ports,
we'll tick TCP and add port 5000.
This is the default port
that our Python application server runs on.
Then click create.
Okay, let's go back to our Compute Engine VM
and start an SSH session.
First, let's update the package repos
with sudo apt-get update.
Let's clear the screen.
Next, we need to install some packages
with sudo apt-get install.
The packages are build-essential, python3-dev,
libncurses5-dev, and virtualenv.
We need all of these packages to build the application.
And let's just clear the screen again.
Now we'll use virtualenv to create a local environment
for our application.
This just creates an isolated runtime of Python
inside a directory called venv,
where we can install extra dependencies.
Now we'll change into that environment
and activate it using source bin/activate.
Now we need to clone the retwis repo from GitHub.
You can find the link for this repo
in the resources section.
Change into the repo directory
and we'll use pip, the Python package manager,
to install the requirements for the application.
Okay, we're nearly ready to run.
We just need the IP address of our Memorystore instance.
Let's go back into the cloud console
and look at the details of our instance.
Let's copy the IP address.
Now we just need to make two small changes
to the application.
Go into the retwis directory.
We need to change the host of our Redis server
in settings.py to the IP address we just copied
from our Memorystore instance details page.
I'm using Vim here, but you can use any editor you like.
Now, change up one directory
and edit the runserver.py file.
We need to tell the application method
to listen on 0.0.0.0, otherwise, it will only respond
to requests on localhost.
Now we can run the application with python runserver.py.
Let's go back to our compute instances page
and we can get the external IP address of our VM.
Copy the address and manually enter it into a browser
with http:// followed by the IP address, then colon 5000.
And here's our Twitter clone.
Click sign up to create an account
and enter any details you like here.
Once you've signed up, you'll be automatically logged in
and you can start posting in your timeline.
I'll just create a couple of tweets here.
I think this is the sort of thing
people put on Twitter, isn't it?
Okay, so it's not much of a Twitter clone.
I mean, there's no random promoted posts for a start,
but you can see that each post is stored
as a key-value entry,
and those are all being written to
and read from our Memorystore instance.
Back in our SSH session,
hit control C to stop the application server.
We'll now install the Redis CLI
to take a closer look at our instance
with sudo apt-get install redis-tools.
You'll need the IP address
of your Memorystore instance again,
but we can remind ourselves of that
by viewing it in the settings file that we edited earlier.
Copy that IP address, and we can connect
directly to our Memorystore instance
with redis-cli -h and the IP address.
We can now view information about our Redis instance
with the INFO command.
With INFO keyspace, we can see
we're only storing eight keys right now.
Again, this is just to prove that accessing Memorystore
is just like accessing any other Redis instance
as far as your application is concerned.
As a data engineer, you just need to know
when Redis is the right fit.
Back in the cloud console,
let's try one more feature of Cloud Memorystore.
Let's create a Cloud Storage bucket.
You can name this anything you want,
but remember the bucket names exist
in a global namespace and cannot be reused.
Click continue and make sure you set the location type
to regional and make sure you set the same region
as your Memorystore instance.
That's going to be us-central1, unless you changed it
when you created the Memorystore instance.
Once you've created our bucket,
we can go back to the Memorystore instance page
and make a backup or an RDB export.
Click the export button, click browse,
and find the bucket you just created, then click select.
Click export,
and Memorystore will export the database to cloud storage.
Back on the instance details page,
we can watch the export complete.
Our database is tiny right now,
but it still takes a minimum amount of time
to complete an export,
regardless of the size of our database.
Pause the video here while you wait for yours to complete.
After a couple of minutes, the export is finished.
In cloud storage, we can go into our bucket
and see the exported file.
Now let's go back to our SSH terminal,
control C to quit out of Redis CLI.
I'll just clear the screen.
And using the up arrow, I'll just find the command
I used to run the server and start the application again.
Back in the browser, let's add one more tweet.
In the Memorystore instance details page,
we could now effectively perform a point in time recovery
by importing the database we just exported.
Go to the import section,
select the file in the cloud storage bucket,
and click import.
Note that it's warning you that this is going
to override all existing data in the database.
Again, it'll take a few minutes to complete.
Pause the video here while you wait for yours to finish.
Now that's done, let's go back to our website.
If we click the address bar
and hit enter to reload the site,
we can see that our last tweet has disappeared.
We've successfully performed a point in time recovery.
Note, don't click the reload icon
or it'll resubmit the form we just posted.
Well, that about sums it up for this lab, Cloud Gurus.
Before you go don't forget to delete
your Memorystore instance,
your Compute VM,
and the custom firewall rule.
Thanks for watching, and keep being awesome, Cloud Gurus.
