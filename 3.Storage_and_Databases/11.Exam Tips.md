Hello, Cloud Gurus to round off this chapter,
here are some quick tips that should help you out
when thinking about storage in the exam.
It sounds simple,
but just choose the right product.
Most storage related questions in the exam
require you to simply choose the correct product
to meet a set of technical and business requirements.
Try to memorize the flow chart we've been using
in this chapter to help you pick.
But this leads me onto my next tip.
Consider the business requirements as well.
Don't just pick the best technical solution.
There may be multiple answers that fulfill the technical
requirements of the question quite well,
but only one will fulfill the nontechnical requirements
as well.
This isn't Google trying to catch you out.
It's just a true reflection of the kind of decision
a real-world data architect must make.
When you're choosing data products,
you need to get to know the ecosystem.
Google data engineers need to help customers
move from on-premise or unmanaged systems to GCP products.
And you can expect questions to be
based around such scenarios,
familiarize yourself with the non-Google
or open source equivalent of storage
and database options in particular,
the Apache Hadoop ecosystem.
My next tip is do the tutorials.
The exam expects you to have considerable experience
managing data and databases.
Expect questions to probe your knowledge
of choosing the correct database, designing schemas,
creating indexes, and tuning performance.
This is obviously way too in depth to fit into this course,
but the tutorials in the GCP documentation
will help reinforce a lot of these skills.
And finally, don't overlook security.
You should learn about the different IAM roles
for each of these services.
And in particular,
how you would use them to separate users
who can write data
from those who just need to read data.
This will almost certainly come up in the exam.
Okay, Cloud Gurus, that's enough exam tips for now,
and that concludes our chapter.
Thanks for watching and I'll see you next time.
