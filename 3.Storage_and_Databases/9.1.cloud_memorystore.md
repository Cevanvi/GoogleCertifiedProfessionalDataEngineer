Hello, Cloud Gurus.
Welcome to this video all about Google's Cloud Memorystore,
the managed Redis service in GCP.
So you can recognize Cloud Memorystore by its service icon,
which looks a little like a memory module,
and that's because Redis is an in-memory database.
You could compare it to Amazon's ElastiCache
or their own managed native Redis service.
The 3 main features of Memorystore to think about
are it's a fully managed Redis instance.
If you need a Redis component in your stack,
but you don't want to have to provision VMs
and configure them, Memorystore will do all of this for you.
In fact, there's not a lot to say about Memorystore,
other than it just does what Redis does,
and it does this in 2 service tiers.
The basic service tier is a zonal resource
that can get you up and running for very little outlay,
but you need to make sure your application
can withstand a cold restart or full data flush,
or if you need something a bit more solid,
the standard tier adds cross-zone replication
and automatic failover.
The benefits of using a managed Redis service are,
like I said, mainly that you don't need to provision
your own VMs.
Of course, provisioning a VM isn't hard,
but configuring it, making it highly available,
scalable, all that stuff takes a lot of scaffolding,
so managed services are usually preferable.
You can scale a Memorystore instance by increasing the
amount of RAM available to it with minimal service impact,
and you can take advantage of Cloud IAM in GCP
to control access and security of your Redis instances.
If you're running in production,
the standard tier adds automatic replication
and failover, which again, are not easy things
to implement by yourself with VMs.
Creating a Redis instance in Memorystore is easy.
Just choose your version.
At the time of recording, that's 3.2 or version 4,
then choose your service tier and a region.
You can choose how much RAM to assign to your instance,
up to 300 gigabytes.
Bear in mind that the amount of RAM assigned to the instance
will determine its maximum network throughput.
You can also optionally add a few Redis parameters
to be applied to the instance when it's created,
such as the max memory policy.
Connecting to Memorystore is just the same
as connecting to the IP address of any other Redis service.
So this is very easy from Compute Engine,
Kubernetes Engine, App Engine, and Cloud Functions,
although for these last 2 options,
you may have to use the serverless VPC connector
if you're connecting to an internal VPC IP address
from a managed serverless service.
Moving data in and out of Memorystore is also very easy.
You can export data to an RDB backup,
although at the time of recording, this feature is in beta.
During an export, you can't perform any admin operations
on your instance, and it may increase
the latency of responses.
The RDB file is written out to Cloud Storage.
Also in beta, you can import from an RDB backup.
Just be aware that an import will override
all the current instance data
with the new data from the RDB file.
Also, your instance won't be available
during the import process
and depending on the size of the import,
this can take quite a long time.
Google quotes about an hour for importing a 100-gigabyte
RDB file into a 120-gigabyte instance.
You can check on the status of an import
through the Cloud Console.
As a data engineer, you should be able to decide
when a service like Memorystore would be a good fit
for a data workload.
Redis is typically used as a persistent session cache,
maybe to store logins or shopping carts,
as a message queue to help loosely-coupled microservices,
or even as a full-blown pub/sub message queue,
although if a pub/sub model is what you need,
you should definitely look at Google Cloud Pub/Sub.
Okay, Cloud Gurus, that about wraps it up
for Cloud Memorystore.
It simply does what it says on the tin,
if you can imagine a tin with the word Redis on it.
I'll see you in the next video!
