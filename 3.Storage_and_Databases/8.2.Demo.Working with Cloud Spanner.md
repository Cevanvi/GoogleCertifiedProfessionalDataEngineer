```

9. Click "CREATE"

Hello Cloud Gurus and welcome to this lab:
Working with Cloud Spanner.
In this lab, we're going to create a cloud spanner instance.
Then set up a database and schema in the console.
Then we'll add some data programmatically, we'll use Python,
but there are code examples for other languages,
which I'll link to in the resources section.
And finally, we'll return to the cloud console
to run some queries.
To complete this lab,
you just need a GCP project and access to the GCP console.
You do need to be mindful of the costs of this lab.
As we know, spanner is not cheap.
Even with just a single node,
it comes in at just under $1 per hour.
You should complete this lab in less than that time,
but please don't forget
to delete your instance when we finished.
If you don't, it could run up a big bill.
Okay, when you're ready, join me in the cloud console.
Okay, here we are in the cloud console.
Let's start by selecting Spanner from the menu.
At this point, enable the cloud Spanner API
if you're prompted to do so.
Click create instance.
We'll name our instance spannerlab,
both for the name and the ID.
The name is for display purposes
whereas the ID is unique and permanent.
Let's choose a regional configuration in us-east-1.
We'll keep the number of nodes at one and click create.
Sometimes spanner sets up very quickly.
Sometimes it takes a few minutes,
so just pause the video here
if you are still waiting for your instance.
Next, we'll create a database.
Click create database, and let's call it demodb.
Click Continue.
Now we have to provide a schema.
Toggle this switch to edit as text
and enter the following schema.
We'll create a table for singers, including an integer ID,
Firstname, and Lastname strings,
and a SingerInfo column of the type bites,
which we could maybe use for a picture.
Then we create a table for albums with integer IDs
for the singer and album
and a string column for the album title.
We specify when we create the albums table
that it should be interleaved with the singer's table
as its parent.
This is going to make lookups on singer's albums
much more efficient.
The ON DELETE CASCADE statement
means that if we delete a singer,
all of that singer's albums
will also be deleted from the database.
Now let's jump into the cloud console
to interact with our new database programmatically.
First, we'll clone Google's Git repo of GCP samples.
I'm using the Python repo here,
but repos for other programming languages
are also available.
I'll put links to all of these Git repos
in the resources section.
Now, let's change to the spanner samples directory.
We'll use virtual end to set up
an isolated Python environment.
We'll then activate that environment with source
env/bin/activate and install the dependencies we need
with pip, Python's package manager.
This sample repo contains a Python script
called snippets.py
that illustrates how to achieve
common database tasks for spanner.
I suggest you have a scroll through this file
in your own time or the equivalent file
for your programming language of choice.
Let's run one of the snippets to insert some data.
We run python snippets.py,
the name of our spanner instance, spannerlab,
the database name, demodb,
and the name of the function we want to invoke,
in this case, insert_with_dml.
Great, it looks like four records have been inserted.
If we have a quick look in snippets.py
we can see online 925
the function that we use to achieve this.
Here you can see the statement that inserts four rows
into the singer's table
although this color syntax isn't very helpful.
Now let's jump to line 63.
This is the function we'll invoke next
to perform a batch mutation.
This will perform multiple inserts
but they'll be applied as an atomic transaction.
If you don't like using Vim,
you can also open this file in the CloudShell editor.
Now, let's quit outta Vim and run this function.
We can just hit the up arrow
to go back through our batch history
and change the name of the function we invoked
to insert data.
And that's completed successfully.
The snippet script contains all sorts of examples
of how to query data programmatically as well,
but instead, let's try with the cloud console.
Just click Query and in the query editor type,
SELECT SingerId, AlbumId, AlbumTitle FROM Albums,
and click run query.
In the results table
we can see five albums from two different singers.
For certain operations, we have to use DDL instead of SQL.
For example, let's say we want to alter our schema
to add a marketing budget for each album.
We can use the altar table statement
but not through this SQL query window.
Let's open our snippet script one more time
and find line 348.
Here we can see the add column method
which executes the altar table statement
so let's run that snippet.
The script reports
that the column has been added successfully.
Back in the console,
we can look at the scheme of our albums table
and there's our new column.
Okay, Cloud Gurus.
Hopefully that's given you a bit of a feel
for working with Cloud Spanner.
Of course, the main benefits of using this
captheorum breaking service are hard to demonstrate
in a lab like this,
but if your organization relied on this sort of data
being available and consistent globally,
you might just store it in Spanner.
Before you finish,
please don't forget to delete your spanner instance.
It will run up quite a big bill if you don't.
Thanks for watching and I'll see you in the next video.
