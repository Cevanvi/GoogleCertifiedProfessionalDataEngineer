Welcome back Cloud Gurus.
So the whole point of this chapter
has been to enable you as a data engineer,
to make decisions about data storage.
In this video,
we'll quickly go over some key concepts again,
and then see what data storage decisions
we might make in different scenarios.
Remember our flow chart from the beginning of the chapter?
You should by now have a good handle
on what most of these options does.
And hopefully, you can spot them just from the service icon.
We haven't covered BigQuery and Bigtable in detail yet
because these are comprehensive services
that will warrant their own chapter in this course.
Let's look at some of the decision points
in this chart in more detail.
So as you navigate the flow chart,
the first question is whether your data
is structured or unstructured.
Structured data can be SQL data, noSQL data,
anything for analytics, or even simple keys and values.
By contrast, unstructured data usually means binary blobs,
such as videos or images, or other proprietary files
that can't be easily read in a structured way.
For unstructured data like this, the choice is simple.
It's Cloud Storage.
Next on the chart, we need to decide
if our data is for analytics.
Let's think for a moment about what that means.
Can't all types of data be used for analytics?
Technically, yes.
But when we're thinking about
analytics data in Google terms,
we're normally talking about huge volumes of data
that we want to analyze over time.
Maybe to make predictions
or even help feed a machine learning model.
That's quite different from relational data
like customer information or product specifications,
for example.
But if we're dealing with analytics,
ask yourself,
do you need a low-latency system or a warehouse?
A low-latency system can still be petabyte scale,
but it's usually single key per row, NoSQL database.
Perfect for storing time series events,
or maybe data from internet of things devices.
For this sort of data, choose Cloud Bigtable.
On the warehouse side of things.
we're still in petabyte scale.
But maybe we need an analytics warehouse where we can store
large volumes of complex data,
but still analyze them with SQL queries.
For this solution, we need BigQuery.
Okay.
How about if our data is not analytical,
it's relational,
like our customer's products and transactions?
For this next choice,
we need to pick between horizontal and vertical scaling.
Firstly, if ANSI SQL is sufficient,
but you really need global replication
with high availability and consistency,
the only choice is really Cloud Spanner.
Maybe you're a financial institution
and you have to guarantee transactions
wherever your customers are in the world.
As well as scale with demand
and meet 5 nines of availability.
If you are a financial institution,
then maybe you can afford it, as Cloud Spanner is not cheap.
But if you need a traditional SQL engine
like MySQL or Postgres,
but you'd rather have a managed service
that can still provide high availability,
look no further than Cloud SQL.
So this leaves our final decision point.
If our data is non-relational,
do we need a traditional, NoSQL database,
or a key value store?
This is really going to come down
to the type of data you're storing.
If you need a managed document database,
the decision is already made for you.
But you're also going to benefit
from strong consistency, mobile SDKs, and offline data,
with Cloud Firestore.
If you just need to store key value data in memory,
you need a managed Redis instance.
Luckily, this one does what Redis does!
It's Cloud Memorystore.
So now, let's go back to our flow chart
and imagine a few different scenarios.
Let's say we've created a wifi access point
that needs to stream time series events
back to our platform,
so we can monitor connection strength
and build a heat map of users connected to wifi.
Well, this data is definitely structured
and we do need to run analytics on it,
but there's a couple of different ways
of handling this next decision.
In the exam, you'll have to look for pointers
in the case study material to help you make the decision.
We absolutely can run analytics on Big Query,
and if we have a team of data analysts who like SQL,
this might make sense.
But streaming thousands of events is expensive
in BigQuery, and it seems more like Cloud Bigtable
might be the database for us.
At a later date,
we could schedule a manipulation of that data
and export it to BigQuery for further analysis.
Or we can build a model using just the data in Bigtable.
In this example,
let's pretend we have an online store
and we need to keep relational records
of things like customers, products, orders, and deliveries.
This is definitely structured
and it's relational, not analytical.
Now again, we need to refer to the clues
in the question or the case study to help us choose.
There's no doubt CloudSpanner could do the job,
but is it overkill?
If so, it's going to cost us a lot of money
that we don't necessarily need to spend.
If in this case, our online store serves
a single region and we can tolerate
a bit of downtime every month,
it might just be that CloudSQL is a perfect fit.
For our final example,
let's say we're setting up the backend platform
for a mobile game.
We need to be able to store user profiles and events,
and we must have great mobile support.
It's structured, but it's not analytics or relational.
In fact, it's a no brainer for this sort of thing,
once mobile is involved,
We'll use CloudFirestore for it's real time database
and offline support.
Okay Cloud Gurus,
have a think about some other data storage use cases,
and work back through the flow chart
to see which products and services you'd choose.
In the exam, you'll need to consider
both the technical and nontechnical requirements
when you make your choice.
Thanks for watching, and I'll see you in the next video.
