Hello Cloud Gurus in this chapter,
we'll be looking at Google's Data Studio,
a tool that allows you to easily create interactive
dashboards and reports.
We'll also be covering some concepts from business
intelligence that relates to business reporting and
dashboarding.
In the first video,
I'll provide a high-level overview of business intelligence.
Let's jump in.
Let's start with the question:
What is business intelligence?
According to Forrester research business intelligence is a
set of methodologies, processes, architectures,
and technologies that transform raw data into meaningful and
useful information to a business.
Data engineering is clearly part of this process.
So as a data engineer,
you are partly responsible for the quality of business
intelligence within your organization.
There are 3 essential areas to business intelligence.
First, we have business reporting.
This is about providing meaningful data and information in
such a way that it can be used to formulate strategy.
Then there is analytics,
the quantification of business processes in order to
facilitate improvements and optimization.
Many different skills are involved here,
including data mining, statistical analysis,
predictive analysis,
business process modeling as well as prescriptive analysis.
With dashboards
high-level key performance indicators and benchmarks are
used to measure progress towards business goals.
So in this chapter, we'll be looking at Data Studio.
Now Data Studio can be used to create reports as well as
dashboards.
The differences between dashboards and reports are not
always 100% clear,
but here I want to discuss some of the general
differences. Remember these don't hold in all cases.
So firstly, for a report,
these generally consists of a detailed set of charts,
tables, and graphs with the emphasis being on detailed.
There is generally a lot of information in reports.
So reports are used for detailed analysis in general.
Now dashboards on the other hand,
tend to view data at a higher level.
So it is more abstracted than in a report. Dashboards
often depict key performance indicators or KPIs that are
relevant to the business. Dashboards allow you to understand
a business's progress at a glance.
Well,
that was certainly a very gentle introduction to business
intelligence. I do hope you found it interesting.
I'll see you in the next video.
