Welcome back Cloud Gurus.
We've taken a look at Data Studio at a high level.
Let's now cover some of these specific charts
that Data Studio allows you to incorporate
into your dashboards and reports.
Let's get going.
So in this video, we'll be looking at charts and filters.
Firstly, we'll be looking at tables,
then we'll look at scorecards.
We'll follow that with pie charts.
Following that we will look at time
series graphs or charts.
Then we'll look at bar charts.
We'll look at geographical maps. We'll look at area charts.
We'll cover scatter plots.
And finally, we'll look at filters and date ranges.
The table is used to display data in a tabular format.
Surprise, surprise. Tables are generally used
in detailed reports where a lot of information
needs to be displayed.
Data Studio then allows you to show certain columns
as bar charts. Data Studio also allows you
to depict numerical columns as heat maps.
Tables also support pagination.
Next, we have scorecards.
Now scorecards are generally used
to show key performance indicators or KPIs.
Now scorecards are generally included in dashboards
because they show information at a very high level.
Let's now look at pie charts.
So pie charts, show proportions in data.
You can depict values as percentages
or as absolute values. On the left,
you can see this example is in percentages.
You can display the pie chart
as a whole pie chart or as a doughnut,
which gives you a segment in the center that's removed.
Pie charts are generally good
where you are working with small amounts of data
or a small number of categorical values.
The downside of pie charts
is that they can be difficult to read accurately.
Now the time series graph or chart.
Data points are indexed in time order.
Time series graphs are great
for trend detection and analysis.
One way of doing that is by fitting a curve
to the graph. Time series graphs are also used
for time series forecasting.
That is to make predictions about the future.
Now for bar charts.
Bar charts are used to show categorical data.
Bar charts can be depicted vertically or horizontally.
Bar charts can be single valued or stacked.
So if you look on the left,
each bar consists of multiple components.
That means it is a stacked bar chart.
Bar charts are great to include in reports
and in dashboards.
Now for geo maps. So geo maps are used
to depict geographical distributions
across geographical areas.
Data Studio allows you to show distributions
across the world, across continents,
or across subcontinents. Geo maps
are generally great for inclusion in dashboards.
Next we have area charts.
Area charts, are great for displaying composition.
Area charts are based on cumulative totals.
This means we can see how individual components
are summed to compose a given value.
Area charts are great
for inclusion in reports and dashboards.
And of course, as you can see on the left here,
you can combine these with time series.
So you can see how a variable evolves over time.
Next we have scatter plots.
Now scatter plots are plotting points
on the Cartesian plane.
Scatter plots are typically based on 2 variables.
That is the X value and the Y value.
However, you can include other variables
and this can be depicted by the color of the points
or by the size of the points.
So over here, you can see that the bigger dots
represent more data or more data included
within that particular point.
Scatter plots a great for inclusion
in dashboards and reports.
Data Studio makes it easy to create interactive reports
and dashboards. So firstly,
a filter will allow a user to select specific values
of a categorical variable to display using a filter.
Secondly, you can allow a user
to display values associated with a date range.
These ranges can be specified with a start date
and an end date,
or you can select predefined ranges
such as last 7 days, last month, last quarter,
last year, etc.
Data Studio also allows you to create charts
that compare data for a specified period,
with data from a previous period.
Okay, Cloud Gurus.
I hope you found this chapter interesting.
If you're working as a data engineer or data scientist,
visualizing data is extremely important.
See you in the next video.
