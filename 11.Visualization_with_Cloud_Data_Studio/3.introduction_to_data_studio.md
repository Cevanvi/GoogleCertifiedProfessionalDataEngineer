Welcome back, Cloud Gurus.
In this video, we'll be looking at Data Studios capabilities
at a high level.
Now, Data Studio is Google's free visualization tool
for creating dashboards and reports.
Let's get going.
So I previously mentioned that Data Studio
can be used to create interactive reports and dashboards.
Now, reports and dashboards are visualizations or depictions
that give meaning to data and make it easier to interpret.
The visible reports and dashboards need to be connected
to some sort of underlying data.
The underlying data are the data sources.
They're referred to as the data sources in Data Studio.
The data can be from databases
or it could be data stored in a file.
Now, Data Studio makes it easy to connect to data
in different locations and in different formats.
The Data Studio data source types
can be broadly categorized as follows.
So firstly, there are files.
These can be normal CSV files
and they are often stored in cloud storage.
They can also be uploaded from your local machine.
Then there are databases.
They are the GCP databases, Big Query, Cloud SQL
and Cloud Spanner.
You can also connect to other databases,
like MySQL and PostgreSQL.
Then there are the Google products.
There are a large number of these products.
The products include Google Analytics, YouTube,
Google Sheets, Google Ads,
and the Google marketing platform.
There are many others that are not shown here.
Finally, there are connectors to third-party products
like Trello, Asana, QuickBooks and Facebook Ads.
There are many, many more of these
that are not depicted here.
If you are familiar with Google Drive,
you'll know how easy it is to share documents and files.
Data Studio is very similar.
You can share your reports and dashboards with others.
So firstly, you can share them
so that they can be viewed by others.
As in the Google Drive,
you can share your reports with specific individuals
or you can create a shareable link
that anyone who has the link can then use
to access your reports or dashboards.
You can also share your reports and dashboards,
such that others are able to edit them.
It is important to remember
that if you share reports with others,
they need access to the underlying data
in order to be able to view or edit
those dashboards or reports.
Okay, Cloud Gurus, that's it for our intro to Data Studio.
In the next video, we'll go into a bit more detail.
See you there.
