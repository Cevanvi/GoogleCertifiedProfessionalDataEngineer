Hey Cloud Gurus.
Welcome back.
In this video, we're going to look at data distributions.
That is the way your data is structured.
We'll be covering a few of the most common
and well-known distributions.
I should mention that it is highly unlikely
that you'll need to know these
for the certification exam.
However, it is highly recommended
that as a data engineer,
you have at least some familiarity
with the main distributions.
Let's jump in.
In data distributions,
we have discrete variables and continuous variables.
Let's start by looking at discrete variables.
A discrete variable can only take
a specific fixed variable.
For example, rolling a dice only returns values
in the set 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 or 6.
The die variable cannot return values
that are between these,
for example 2.5.
That's not allowed.
A distribution over a discrete variable
will often take the following form.
The graph is discontinuous.
You can see that there is a value at 5
while there is no value at 5 and a half,
which falls between 5 and 6.
Even though the bars cover the points near 5,
this doesn't mean that it can take on those values.
This is just so that the bars have some width
so that we can see them.
Now, a continuous variable can take on any value
within a specified range.
For example, the temperature can take on
an intermediate value between any 2 degrees,
for example 21.3 degrees Celsius.
A distribution over a continuous variable
will often take the following form.
Continuous distributions consist in smooth lines,
and every point of the X axis
has a corresponding value on the Y axis.
You can see that there is a value at 5.
There is now also a value at 5 and a half.
In fact, there is a value for every real number
between 5 and 6.
So let's now take a look at some
of the most common distributions
we encounter when analyzing data.
There is the Bernoulli distribution.
There is the uniform distribution.
There is the binomial distribution,
the normal distribution,
the Poisson distribution,
as well as the exponential distribution.
We'll now be looking at each 1 of these
in a little more detail.
The Bernoulli distribution is a really simple distribution.
The X variable is only able to take on
1 of 2 values, 0 or 1.
And so it's discrete.
The X variable cannot take a value of 1.3, for example.
When using this distribution,
the X value 0 and 1.
will often be mapped onto real-world events.
So in the examples shown here,
0 denotes losing,
and 1 denotes winning.
The Bernoulli distribution is based
on a single trial or outcome.
That could be a measurement, for example.
So, for example,
if there is a cricket game between 2 teams
and team A has a 0.2 probability of losing
and a 0.8 probability of winning,
we could depict it as the graph on the left.
Here is a mathematical equation
that represents the Bernoulli distribution.
You definitely do not need to know this
for the certification.
If you come across it when working,
you can always look up the equation.
The important thing to note is that the probabilities
associated with winning and losing
must add up to 1.
So if the probability of winning is 0.8,
then the chance of losing has to be 0.2.
Next let's look at the uniform distribution.
With the uniform distribution,
all outcomes are equally likely.
It follows that there is a constant probability
associated with each outcome.
It is possible to have discrete
or continuous uniform distributions.
An example of a discrete uniform distribution
is a fair die where the probability
of getting any particular number 1 to 6
is 1 divided by 6.
For a continuous uniform distribution
depicted by the graph on the left,
we have a constant probability
defined on the interval A-B.
The probability at any point X
given by PX is equal to 1 over B minus A.
You can see that if you multiply
the length of the interval B minus A
by the probability at each point
1 over B minus A, you get 1.
Let's now consider the binomial distribution.
The Bernoulli distribution
is a discrete probability distribution.
There are 2 possible outcomes.
For example, win or lose.
Now, the binomial experiment
is similar to the Bernoulli experiment
in that there are 2 possible outcomes.
However, the Bernoulli distribution
is related to a single trial example,
a single game of cricket,
whereas the binomial distribution
results where there are N identical games.
Each trial or outcome is independent of the others.
So when throwing a die,
each die throw is independent
of the previous values
that were obtained by throwing the die.
This is the equation for the binomial distribution.
I'm not going to read it.
The exclamation mark symbol refers to a factorial.
The factorial is the product of all the positive integers
less than or equal to the number ending in 1.
Normal distributions are extremely common in nature.
So for example, if we look at the height of humans,
we tend to have a normal distribution.
In fact, if we look any natural variable,
we tend to have a normal distribution.
In a normal distribution,
the mean, median, and mode are all equal.
The distribution is symmetrical about the mean or mu.
Remember the mean is calculated by summing all the values
and then dividing by the number of values.
With a normal distribution,
the area under the curve is 1,
and the normal distribution
is given by this equation.
Here, mu is the average
and sigma is the standard deviation.
Now, the Poisson distribution
models events that happen randomly in time or space.
An example of a Poisson distribution
would be the number of calls
you receive on your phone each day.
Poisson distributions occur
where events have a constant mean rate.
The Poisson distribution
is generally not symmetrical about the mean.
So Poisson distributions are used to model
the number of times an event occurs
in time or space.
The equation for a Poisson distribution
is shown here.
Here, E is the base of the natural logarithm,
sometimes called Euler's number.
Lambda is the expected value of X.
Let's now look at our final distribution,
the exponential distribution.
The exponential distribution models the time
between events in a Poisson point process.
So if we stick with the example
we gave in the Poisson distribution
of the number of calls you receive each day,
then the exponential distribution
models the time it takes
before your next phone call.
If we think in terms of space, for example,
an exponential distribution could be used
to model the distance between successive mutations
on a DNA strand.
The equation for an exponential distribution
is given as follows.
Lambda is the rate parameter.
Okay, that's it for the chapter on data distributions.
Remember, you won't be expected to know these
for the certification exam,
but it is good to have some familiarity with them
if you plan to work in data engineering
or data science.
See you in the next video.
