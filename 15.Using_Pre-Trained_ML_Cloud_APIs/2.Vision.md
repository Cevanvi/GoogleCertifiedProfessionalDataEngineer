Okay, welcome back, Gurus.
In this chapter,
we'll be covering some of the core capabilities
within the vision AI building block.
We'll be focusing on vision in this video.
The vision API allows you to derive insights
from static images in the cloud
or at the edge.
It's worth noting at this point
that the vision API can run in one of 2 modes.
There is the synchronous mode where responses
are returned immediately.
And then there is the asynchronous mode
where a long-running operation is started
that only returns results
once it has completed.
For asynchronous annotation of images,
we normally process many images
as part of a batch job.
In this context, synchronous processing
is also known as online processing
and asynchronous processing
is known as offline processing.
Okay, let's consider some of the capabilities
that are available with the vision API.
We'll start with optical character recognition
or OCR.
Here, the vision API identifies
and extracts text from images.
There are 2 annotation features
that support OCR,
and these are text detection
and document text detection.
Let's start with text detection.
This does pretty much what you'd expect.
It identifies and extracts text from images.
The JSON extraction response
contains the extracted text
together with all the individual words
that occurred in that text.
Additionally, bounding boxes
are specified for each block of text.
Text detection can also be used
to extract handwritten text from images.
Then we have document text detection.
This also extracts text from images,
but the response is optimized
for dense text and documents.
The JSON extraction response
includes page information, blocks, paragraphs, words,
as well as page break information.
Consider this image.
The vision API is able to suggest
a crop region on the image.
The JSON response specifies
the vertices of the suggested crop region.
Now, I think the original picture of the bird
is pretty close to perfect,
so I wouldn't crop this one.
The vision API is also able to do face detection.
Face detection is able to identify
multiple faces within an image.
It also identifies facial attributes
such as emotional state,
or if the person is wearing some sort of headgear.
The vision API does not support
specific individual facial recognition.
If you're watching this and you're a celebrity,
you're not so lucky as the vision API
does offer celebrity recognition.
Maybe soon, we'll all be celebrities.
Next we have image property detection.
The vision API is also able to identify
certain image properties like the dominant colors.
The set of dominant colors used within an image
could be useful for grouping images
or perhaps for some sort of image recommendation.
Label detection is a key component of the vision API.
Label detection refers to the ability to identify
and label objects, locations, activities,
animal species, products,
and many other things that exist within an image.
The vision API is very powerful,
detecting objects from a wide range of categories.
As an example, let's consider this image of a cityscape.
A fairly large number of labels are identified.
Each identified object has a corresponding score.
As is common with categorization,
the score denotes the certainty
that the label is correct.
So here we would have a city,
car, street, building, et cetera.
Okay, Gurus, let's start this slide with a quiz.
Landmark detection allows you to identify
what in an image.
Yes, you are correct.
It allows you to identify landmarks in an image.
Landmark detection detects popular,
natural as well as man-made structures
that may be shown within an image.
Landmark detection provides the name of the landmark,
the bounding polygon vertices,
as well as the latitude and longitude
of the landmark.
Logo detection detects popular product logos
within an image.
This could be a very useful facility
in a number of retail applications, for example.
The vision API also provides the ability
to detect explicit content within images.
Explicit content could be adult content
or violent content.
5 categories are used
by the safe search detection feature.
These are adult, spoof, medical, violence, and racy.
And as you would by now expect,
each of these categories is associated with a likelihood
that it is present within the image.
So we have an image here,
but is it safe to look at?
We ran it through the safe search detection,
and it's fine.
Safe search detection can be done on images
in cloud storage or on the web.
Web detection identifies web references to an image,
that is, pages and other web artifacts
that use the image in some way.
There are a number of categories.
We have web entities,
fully matching images,
partially matching images.
This could be where this particular image
has been clipped, for example.
It returns links to web pages
with matching images.
It returns links to visually similar images.
And finally, it provides best guess labels.
Best guess label for this might be
surfers walking on beach.
Okay, Gurus, I hope you've found this video interesting,
and that you're able to think of some of the ways
in which you could use
the incredibly powerful vision capabilities
in your solutions.
See you in the next video.
