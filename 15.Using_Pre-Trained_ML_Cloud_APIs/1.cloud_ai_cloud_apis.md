Hello, Cloud Gurus! In this chapter,
we'll be looking at Google's pre-trained
machine learning models.
We mentioned them briefly in the chapter
on machine learning.
These APIs are super exciting, because they give you
fast access to functionality
that was really only dreamed of just a few years ago.
In this chapter, we'll go through the cloud APIs,
focusing on what functionality is available with each API.
There's a good chance you'll be able to bring
some of these capabilities into your own organization.
In this first video, we'll contextualize
the pre-trained APIs from a slightly
different perspective to that that we took
in the machine learning chapter.
Then we'll go into detail on each one
in the following videos. Let's go.
Google divides their AI products
into 3 broad categories.
First, we have the AI building blocks.
This is where the pre-trained API sit.
We'll be looking at these shortly. Next, we have the AI hub.
The AI hub facilitates sharing of AI resources
within an organization.
It's billed as a hosted repository of
plug and play AI components.
These resources can include end-to-end pipelines built
within the organization, or standard algorithms that are
likely to be useful in solving common business problems
within that organization.
It is an excellent way to foster collaboration.
I've personally been at organizations where great work
was done on building models to solve specific problems,
but where the models and pipelines
were not generally available.
This resulted in these models becoming less and less useful
over time as there was concept drift.
And because no one in the organization really knew how they
were built and trained, they were slowly phased out.
For data engineers and scientists, this is a small tragedy.
So, don't let this happen within your organization.
Consider using AI Hub to organize your AI resources.
Then there is AI Platform.
AI platform has a large number of components to help you
build, deploy, and support end-to-end
machine learning solutions.
AI Platform includes AI Platform Notebooks.
This is a managed service for Jupyter Lab environments.
Deep Learning Virtual Machine Images:
These are pre-configured virtual machines
for deep learning environments.
Deep Learning Containers:
These are pre-configured and optimized containers
for deep learning environments.
Then there is AI Platform Training:
This facilitates distributed training
and includes automatic hyperparameter tuning.
AI Platform Predictions:
This facilitates serverless hosting
of your machine learning models.
Continuous Evaluation: models can be optimized
using ground truth labels.
There is a What-If Tool.
This is a model evaluation tool
that uses a visual interface.
Cloud TPUs, (Tensor Processing Units)
for great training performance.
And finally there's Q flow,
which is a machine learning toolkit for Kubernetes.
You don't have to remember all of that.
That's just to give you a sense of what is available.
Let's consider the AI building blocks.
The AI building blocks comprise four main areas:
There is sight, language, conversation, and structured data.
Within the sight building block, we have vision and video.
Within the language building block,
we have translation and natural language.
In conversation, we have dialogue flow,
text-to-speech, and speech to text.
And in the structured data component,
we have auto ML tables, recommendation AI,
and the cloud inference API.
We'll be going into these in a lot more detail in the
upcoming videos. That's it for this first video.
See you in the next one.
