Welcome back, Cloud Gurus.
We've got to grips with the basics of Pub/Sub
and we understand how messages flow through topics
in some of the most common patterns.
Now let's gain an understanding
of some of Pub/Sub's advanced features and uses.
As we stated before,
Pub/Sub guarantees something called at least once delivery.
This means that every message published to a topic
will be received at least once
by every subscription to that topic.
Because of the way Pub/Sub guarantees
this level of global availability,
there is a small chance you may receive a message
more than once in a single subscription.
We'll talk about how you can handle this in a moment
when we come to ordering messages.
Undelivered messages will be deleted after a period of time
called the message retention duration.
By default, this is 7 days,
although you can configure it to be as little as 10 minutes.
It can't be longer than 7 days; however,
and it's worth noting that messages published to a topic
before a subscription is created
will not be delivered to that subscription.
It can't backfill in old messages.
This also means that if you send messages
to a topic that has no subscriptions,
those messages won't be delivered anywhere.
Subscriptions also have a specific lifecycle.
If there's no activity for a subscription for 31 days,
so no pulls or no successful pushes,
the subscription will be removed.
And if you happen to recreate that subscription
with the same name,
it will still bear no relationship
to the previous subscription.
That means the new subscription will only get new messages
subsequently sent to the topic
after the subscription is created.
If you had a bunch of messages waiting in the topic
for your previous subscription,
but you didn't try and get them for more than 31 days,
they'll be gone.
These are just the defaults though.
You can set this expiry to go up to 365 days
or set a subscription to have no expiry.
So far, we've been describing
the standard model of using Pub/Sub,
but there are some limitations to this approach.
Acknowledged messages
are no longer available to subscribers.
Once a message has been delivered,
it can't be accessed again in the topic.
And this also means that a subscriber has to process
every single message it's subscribed to,
even if it only needs a subset of them.
In most normal businesses' usual cases,
these limitations aren't really a problem,
but maybe you need some extra flexibility,
perhaps to cover for an application outage
or even an upgrade.
You can be more flexible with Pub/Sub
using the seek feature.
To explain how this works,
let's first think about the timeline
of a normal workflow in Pub/Sub.
As we move through time,
a publisher sends messages to a topic.
And as long as there's a subscriber
with a subscription to that topic,
they'll receive the messages.
Once they're received and acknowledged,
they no longer exist inside the topic.
And of course, if we take away the subscription,
the messages don't go anywhere.
However, we can also tell Pub/Sub
to retain acknowledged messages
by setting retain acked messages to true
on the subscription itself.
So even though messages are acknowledged,
a copy of them is still kept inside the Pub/Sub service.
By default, messages are retained
for the maximum of 7 days,
although you can adjust this to a shorter period
if you want to.
Once our messages are retained,
we can tell our subscription to seek
to a specific timestamp.
This effectively rewinds the clock
and our subscriber will be able to retrieve
and acknowledge these messages again,
starting from the timestamp.
Note, the messages are still stored
after being received again up to that retention window.
You can also use this feature
to seek to a point in the future
if you want to effectively discard any of the messages
that may be waiting for your subscription in the topic.
You can also use snapshots
instead of seeking to a particular time.
These can be useful if you're deploying new code
and you're not sure how your new code
will deal with the messages in your subscription.
By setting a snapshot ahead of time,
the current state of the subscription is saved,
including any unacknowledged messages
and all future messages for that subscription
up to the retention limits.
If you need to,
you can then seek back to that snapshot in time
and replay all of the messages from there.
Okay, let's talk about some other advanced features.
Now, because Pub/Sub is highly available
and globally scalable, there is a trade-off
in that it can't guarantee message ordering.
Sometimes a subscriber may receive messages
in a different order from the one they were published in.
But if you think about it for a lot of cases,
that's probably okay.
When you're using Pub/Sub as an event bus
to couple services together,
it's more important that there is a message
than the exact time that it was sent or received.
If you need to be able to order events or messages
once they reach their final destination,
say for example for log file events,
you can attach a timestamp to the metadata of every message.
The order these messages go through topics to subscribers
still isn't guaranteed.
But if the timestamp is attached at the time of sending,
then you at least have a record of that time
in the system that you can query.
If you absolutely need to guarantee the order
in which messages are processed by subscribers,
you potentially need to consider an alternative system
to help you achieve this.
You could, for example, store the ordered list of timestamps
of every created message in a cloud file store
or Cloud SQL instance,
then have the subscriber application
query this separate database
to check if the message has already been processed.
Obviously, this is going to add significant latency
to every transaction.
Let's quickly talk about how Pub/Sub stores messages.
As a global managed service,
Pub/Sub can store messages anywhere in GCP.
Published messages are by default stored in the region
nearest to where they were published from.
However, you can define a message storage policy,
which will let you choose a specific region or regions
for the storage of messages.
Be aware though that this can lead
to additional egress fees.
For example, if a message is published in region A
and must be stored in region B
according to your custom policy.
To monitor your use of Pub/Sub
and make sure it's a healthy happy part of your stack,
there are dozens of Stackdriver metrics available.
I'll put a link in the resources section
to the complete list,
but some notable metrics are topic/byte_cost
to see the overall utilization of a topic,
and subscription/byte_cost
to see the overall utilization of a subscription.
Note that both of these metrics return values in bytes,
but quotas are defined in kilobytes.
Subscription/num_undelivered_messages
is the number of unacknowledged,
or in other words backlogged messages, in a subscription.
Keep an eye on this one,
with subscription/oldest_unacked_message_age,
which is the age of the oldest message in that backlog.
If the number of undelivered messages goes up gradually
along with the age of the oldest message,
you know there's definitely a problem with the subscriber.
And for push subscriptions,
keep an eye on subscription/num_outstanding_messages.
This is the total number of messages waiting to be received
by a push subscription endpoint.
To round up, we mustn't forget access control.
Like most GCP services,
you should control permissions with Cloud IAM
and use custom service accounts for authorization.
Rather than grant sweeping permissions across a project,
you can grant service accounts access
to only specific topics or subscriptions,
and you can even limit access
to only publish or consume messages.
So if an application needs to consume messages
from a subscription,
you could give it only this permission and nothing else.
Again, we're supporting the security principle
of least privilege.
I'll put a link to the Pub/Sub IAM documentation
in the resources section.
Okay, Cloud Gurus, that about wraps it up for this lecture.

please feel free to ask me in the forum.
And if not, I'll see you in the next video.
