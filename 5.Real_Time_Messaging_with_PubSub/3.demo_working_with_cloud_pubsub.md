Hello, Cloud Gurus and welcome
to the first lab of this chapter,
Working with Cloud Pub/Sub.
In this lab, we're going to create some Pub/Sup topics
and subscriptions, then we'll see how to publish messages
and consume them.
And we'll do all this in the Cloud Console,
as well as with the gcloud command line tool.
All you need for this lab is a GCP project
and we'll do everything via the Cloud Console
and it's built in Cloud Shell.
So, jump into your GCP project and let's get started.
So, here we are in the GCP Cloud Console.
Let's practice interacting with Pub/Sub
through this interface first,
before we tackle the command line.
First, select Pub/Sub from the burger menu.
You'll find it under the Big Data section.
We'll hide the info panel first.
Then to create a topic, just click Create Topic.
We'll call us LabTopic.
Note how we can see the full path to the topic here,
which includes our project name.
We'll let Google manage the encryption keys
and click, Create Topic.
And now, we've created a Pub/Sub topic.
It's really as simple as that.
Of course, without a subscription,
our topic is basically a black hole.
Messages just have nowhere to go,
so let's create a subscription.
First, go back to the list of topics
and click the 3 dots here
to access some further options.
Then, click Create Subscription.
We'll call our subscription, LabSub.
We'll leave the delivery type as Pull
and accept all the other default settings.
Scroll down and click Create.
Now, we know there's a subscription
that can receive messages for our topic.
Let's create a message.
Go back to the topics page into lab topic
and click Publish Message.
You can type anything you want in here.
I'm going to type Hello Cloud Gurus!
Then click publish.
That message is now queued up in our Pub/Sub topic.
We can view it by clicking View Messages,
which will let us act as a subscriber,
right inside the Cloud Console.
This isn't something you'd normally do
in a production environment, but it's useful for setup
and testing purposes.
First, select the subscription that we just created.
Then click Pull.
And there's the message that we just published.
Notice, we didn't select this checkbox
to enable ACK messages or acknowledgement messages.
And now, the deadline has been exceeded
for us to acknowledge the receipt of the message.
This means the message stays in the queue
because Pub/Sub doesn't know for sure
that we definitely received it.
Let's try again, but this time, we'll enable ACK messages.
Now we can see our message and quickly click ACK
to acknowledge it.
This is how a production Pub/Sub client would operate.
The message has been received successfully,
so we acknowledge that, which pops it off the top
of the queue of our topic.
Now, if we try to pull one more time, we'll see,
there are no more messages waiting for our subscription.
Let's try one more thing
to prove the delivery wants promise.
Go back to the topics list and copy the full path
of the topic by clicking this link here.
Now, we'll go to subscriptions and create a new one.
We'll call this, LabSub2
and paste the full topic name here.
Leave everything else as the default and click Create.
Now, let's go back to our topic and publish another message.
Click Create Message.
And type anything you like here.
And click Publish Message.
Now, we'll view that message by clicking View Messages.
Select the first subscription we created.
Tick Enable ACK Messages, and then Pull.
As soon as you see the message,
click the link to acknowledge it.
Now, let's click Pull again and you can see
that this subscriber no longer has any messages.
But what about our other subscription?
Let's try that.
Click Pull again and there's our message.
And we'll quickly acknowledge it.
Each subscriber is guaranteed to get each message once.
This is an example of the one-to-many pattern.
Okay, now it's time to try accessing Pub/Sub
from the command line.
Let's open the Cloud Shell.
And we'll click this icon to open the Cloud Shell
in its own tab.
We're going to use the gcloud command
to interact with Pub/Sub.
Like every other GCP service, Pub/Sub has a specific set
of gcloud sub commands that all start, gcloud pubsub.
We can view the topic we created
with gcloud pubsub topics list.
We can create new topics with gcloud pubsub topics create
and then the name of a topic.
Let's create a new topic called LabTopic2.
And we'll delete our original topic
with gcloud pubsub topics delete LabTopic.
If we run gcloud pubsub topics list again,
we can see that it's gone.
Okay, let's clear the screen.
Now, let's create a subscription for a new topic
with gcloud pubsub subscriptions create --topic
and the name of our new topic.
And then, LabSub3 is the name of our subscription.
Don't forget, we already have subscriptions called
LabSub and LabSub2.
We can see our subscriptions
with gcloud pubsub subscriptions list.
The output of that command is quite verbose.
So alternatively, we can view subscriptions
for a specific topic
with gcloud pubsub topics list-subscriptions
and the name of the topic.
Let's clear the screen again.
So now, let's publish the messages to our new topic.
We'll add some numbers to our messages
to help us keep track of them.
We can publish a message with gcloud pubsub topics publish,
the name of the topic, --message and then a string.
And then any message you like.
The gcloud command returned successfully with the ID
of our message.
Let's send a couple more messages to our topic.
Use the up arrow to access your shell history
and just change the message.
Let's do that one more time.
Now that we've written some messages,
we can use our subscription to pull them.
Let's just clear the screen.
We can do this with gcloud pubsub subscriptions pull,
the name of the subscription.
And we add the --auto-ack option to tell gcloud
to automatically acknowledge the message,
which will remove it from the queue of messages,
waiting for their subscription.
We've now received the first message that was queued up
for this subscription.
And this message no longer exists in that queue,
as we automatically acknowledged it.
If we run the command again,
just hit the up arrow to retrieve it.
We'll get the next message in the queue.
Let's do it one more time and we'll get the next one.
If we try it one more time,
we'll see that there are no messages left.
If we want to, we can pull more than one message
at once with gcloud.
But first, we'll need to publish some more messages,
as our queue is now empty.
We'll use the Bash command, history,
to see all the commands that we've just run.
We can then use the exclamation point
and the number of a command to rerun it.
I'm going to rerun commands 1,010, 1,011 and 1,012
to republish those messages.
Now, let's clear the screen again.
And we'll pull the messages
with gcloud pubsub subscriptions pull LabSub3 --auto-ack
and we'll also add --limit=3 to specify a limit
of 3 messages, rather than the default of 1.
And now, we're witness to one of the quirks of Pub/Sub.
In order to make Pub/Sub's architecture
so globally available with such low latency,
message ordering can't be guaranteed.
We'll look at ways to deal with this later in the chapter.
In the meantime, we just need to run the command again
to get the remaining message that wasn't quite ready for us.
Now, we've retrieved all 3 messages,
the queue will be empty again.
Let's clear the screen.
Now, we can delete this topic
with gcloud pubsub topics delete LapTopic2.
So now, we should no longer have any Pub/Sub topics
in our project.
Let's check with gcloud pubsub topics list.
And we have no topics.
If we run gcloud pubsub subscriptions list,
we can see that we still have our subscriptions,
but they all reference a deleted topic.
They're essentially dangling subscriptions
that will never receive messages again.
Let's put them out of their misery
with gcloud pubsub subscriptions delete LabSub.
Then, we'll do the same for LabSub2.
And finally, for the LabSub3 subscription.
As we've now tidied up all of our resources,
that includes this lab.
Great job, Cloud Gurus!
And I'll see you in the next video.
