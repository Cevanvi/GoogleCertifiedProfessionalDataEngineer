Hello, Cloud Gurus, and welcome to this chapter
where we'll take a deep dive on Google's Cloud Pub/Sub.
Pub/Sub handles messaging and event ingestion
at a global level.
But to understand that,
let's first discuss why we would use messaging middleware
in the first place.
So let's imagine a scenario
where we don't use any sort of messaging middleware layer.
Say, we have some users who we want to serve with our app.
The communication between the 2 can be direct.
The user talks directly to the app,
maybe through a web browser,
but it's a direct link from one to the other.
Maybe in addition to our user,
there's another app that needs to talk to our initial app.
Maybe it's running in another cloud or in a data center,
but again, it talks directly to our app.
You might already be thinking of some problems
with this design.
All of these direct connections
don't seem to have much resilience built into them.
Now let's say our app gets popular.
We're getting more users
and more third-party apps connecting to us, but that's okay.
We know how to autoscale in GCP.
So we add more compute to handle the load.
Now let's say we have a backend app in our stack
and maybe there are some mobile devices
that need to send data directly to this part of the stack,
but it's dependent on some data from the frontend.
It can't act until it's got both pieces of information
and maybe there's a further component to our stack
that relies on the outcome of the second component,
but it can only talk to the frontend
because of its geolocation.
This is all starting to look a bit tenuous.
What happens if this part breaks?
Well, there goes our mobile data
and now the frontend can't finish
what it's supposed to be processing, so it starts blocking.
Eventually, this causes our original application
to start crashing.
We're left with a system that can barely handle
its frontend requests
and the response to those requests
is probably just, please try again later.
So where did it all go wrong?
Well, the fundamental problem
with this design is dependency.
Every component is dependent on some other component
in order for it to function.
And often, it's relying on things to happen
in a certain order that can't be guaranteed.
The second that one component has a problem,
well, the whole house of cards comes tumbling down.
The solution to this design problem
is to introduce messaging middleware or a message bus,
whatever your preferred name for it.
This is simply a layer that we introduce
that handles all of the messages
that used to be passed directly between each component.
There are different models of message bus,
but we're going to use the publish/subscribe model.
In this model, our message bus can be split
into different groups of messages.
In Pub/Sub, we call these Topics.
Anything can publish a message to a topic
or choose to receive a message from a topic.
So now information from our users and other apps
is published to a topic
which can be consumed by our application.
Our user client can also be updated
to simply pull information back from a topic
when it needs to.
Mobile data can be sent to another topic
to be consumed by our backend application.
And we can have a separate topic that we choose to act on
only when there are messages there ready for us to receive.
In this way, we've loosely coupled our services
with a message bus and in doing so,
we've introduced resilience
in the event of a single component failure.
Because in our case,
Pub/Sub is a global fully-managed service,
messages can simply queue in the topic,
ready to be consumed again when a component is restored.
In this way, you can think of Pub/Sub
as a kind of shock absorber for your systems.
Pub/Sub works equally well for exchanging messages and data
around a distributed system,
as well as simple triggers and events,
acting on certain actions
and triggering other actions to occur.
We'll see some examples of this later in the chapter.
Now we understand
why we'd want to use messaging in our stack.
Let's talk about Cloud Pub/Sub specifically.
Pub/Sub is Google's global messaging
and event ingestion service.
Using the publisher/subscriber model,
it can handle messages or events consistently
in multiple regions as a serverless, NoOps,
fully-managed service.
There is nothing to provision.
You simply consume the Pub/Sub API,
which like many other GCP products,
is a public-facing version of a tool Google have been using
and developing internally for years.
Google's internal Pub/Sub handles messages and events
for ads, Gmail, and search,
processing up to 500 million messages per second,
totaling over one terabyte per second of data.
Cloud Pub/Sub has some great features,
including multiple publisher and subscriber patterns.
We'll get into more detail on those in the next video,
but there are different relationships you can set up
between publishers and subscribers,
such as one to many, many to one, and many to many.
Pub/Sub guarantees at-least-once delivery of every message.
In fact, due to its distributed
and globally replicated nature, there's a tiny chance
you might get a message more than once,
although this is rare.
You can process messages in real-time or batches
depending on your design pattern with exponential back off
for publishing and push subscriptions.
And if you need more advanced time windowing
or exactly once processing,
you can integrate Pub/Sub with Cloud Dataflow.
Some common use cases of Pub/Sub and systems like it
include distributing workloads.
For example, you could queue up a large number of tasks
in a Pub/Sub topic
and have them distribute it amongst multiple workers,
such as Compute Engine instances.
Each instance can grab a task in turn from its subscription.
New tasks can be queued up, waiting for available capacity.
Asynchronous workflows,
for when you need to control the order of events
in a loosely coupled system.
For example, an order processing system could place an order
in a topic which could then be consumed by a worker system,
perhaps invoicing, before passing it into a queue
for the next system to consume,
perhaps packaging and posting.
Distributing event notifications.
Let's say, for example, you have a system that sets up
new users when they register with your service.
A registration could publish a message
and your system could be notified to set the user up.
Distributed logging.
Rather than pushing logs to a single source,
they could be sent to a Pub/Sub topic
to be consumed by multiple subscribers,
such as a monitoring system
and an analytics database for later querying.
And device data streaming.
Hundreds, thousands, even hundreds of thousands
of internet-connected devices can stream their data
or telemetry into Pub/Sub topics
to be consumed on-demand by your analytic streams
or even transformed through Dataflow first.
These are just some of the most common use cases.
Often, you'll see Pub/Sub used as the glue
that adds logic and joins lots of other services together
in a topology of GCP services.
Okay, Cloud Gurus,
now we understand the concepts behind Pub/Sub
and what it can be used for,
join me in the next video where we'll go over the basics
of how we actually use Pub/Sub.
