Hello Cloud Gurus
and welcome to our next Pub/Sub lab
where we'll get to grips with the Client Libraries.
In this lab, we're going to create Pub/Sub topics
and subscriptions programmatically.
Then, we'll publish and consume messages
from within an application.
For this lab, we'll be using Python,
but I'll provide links to the Client Libraries
and documentation for other programming languages
in the resources section.
Again, all you need for this lab is a GCP project.
We'll work inside the Cloud Console with Cloud Shell.
We'll also use the Cloud Shell Editor
to write and edit some Python code.
So as soon as you're ready, join me in your GCP project.
So here we are in our GCP project,
we're going to start by opening the Cloud Shell.
Then, we're going to run the Cloud Shell Editor
so we can run some commands and also look under the hood
at the source code while we're doing it.
Sometimes when you open the Cloud Shell
detached from the Cloud Console,
it can forget your project ID.
You can reset it with gcloud config set project
and then the ID of your project.
As I said, we're going to be using Python here,
but the other Client Libraries work in much the same way
as they're exposing the same parts of the Pub/Sub API.
For Python, there's a few steps we need to take
to create a local development environment.
First, we'll make sure our Cloud Shell is up to date
with sudo apt-get update.
Then, we'll install virtualenv,
which allows us to run isolated instances of Python.
We'll do this with sudo apt-get install virtualenv.
It's possible your Cloud Shell
already contains this package.
Now we'll use virtualenv to create a new Python environment
with virtualenv -p python3 venv.
Venv is just the name of the directory
where our environment will be created.
If you've done this before
or you already have a directory called venv,
you'll need to call the environment something else.
Next, activate the environment
with source venv/bin/activate.
Okay, now we're in our new environment.
Let's install the Client Libraries for Pub/Sub
with PIP, the Python Package Manager.
We do this with pip install --upgrade google-cloud-pubsub.
And finally, we'll grab the samples
from Google Cloud's GitHub Repo.
This repo contains, amongst other things,
sample Python scripts
that show us how to use the Pub/Sub Client Libraries
to perform common tasks.
You can copy the link to this repo
from the resources section.
Once that's cloned, in the Cloud Shell Editor,
let's open the python docs samples directory.
Scroll all the way down to Pub/Sub,
then into the cloud-client directory and open publisher.py.
In our terminal,
we'll need to change into this directory as well.
You should be able to tab complete most of this.
Let's just clear the terminal.
So first, let's create a new topic.
We'll call it lab topic.
We can use this Python script to do this for us
by running python publisher.py,
the name of your GCP project, create LabTopic.
The Python script tells us that the topic
has been created successfully.
Let's jump into the code and see what really happened.
In the file you have opened, find line 42.
This is the function we just invoked
and we can see it expects 2 arguments:
project ID and topic name.
The function imports the Pub/Sub library,
then it starts a connection to the Pub/Sub API
by creating a new publisher client and calling it publisher.
Next, we'll create a variable called topic_path
that creates the full topic path
of the topic we want to create.
As you can recall from seeing these in the Cloud Console,
the full path contains the project ID
as well as the topic name.
Then we simply invoke create_topic on the publisher client
and send the result to a new variable called topic.
Let's check that the topic definitely exists
with gcloud pubsub topics list.
Of course it does.
In the same directory,
open the file subscriber.py in the editor.
We'll use this script to create a new subscription
for our topic.
Let's run the script with python subscriber.py,
the name of your GCP project, create,
the name of our topic which is LabTopic,
and a new name for our subscription,
which we'll call LabSub.
The script returns with the details of our new subscription.
Let's take a look at the code that accomplished this.
In subscriber.py, jump to line 58.
In here, we can see the function
which this time needs 3 arguments:
a project name, topic name, and a subscription name.
Again, we import the client libraries.
This time, we create a new subscriber client
called subscriber.
We define the topic path as we saw before,
then we define a full subscription path
based on the arguments passed into the function.
Then, we simply call the create_subscription method
on our subscriber client to create the subscription.
While we're in this file, let's jump to line 166
and we'll look at the example function
for receiving messages.
Just like before, we import the Client Libraries,
we create a subscriber client,
and establish the subscriber path.
Then we do something quite interesting.
We create a callback function here
that will print a message that's passed into it
and acknowledge that message
by calling its own built-in ACK function.
Then, we call the subscribe method on our subscriber client
passing in our subscription path
and the callback method we've just defined.
The subscribe method will periodically check
for new messages and pass them to our callback function
when they are received.
As the comments say, this method is non-blocking
so we have to keep the main thread alive
with this perpetual while loop.
Let's clear the terminal
and let's start this up in our shell
with python subscriber.py, the name of your GCP project,
receive, and the name of the subscription, LabSub.
The script starts running
and tells us it's listening for messages.
So now, rather than use the GCP examples,
let's write a quick Python script of our own
to publish the messages.
We'll write a script that queries in API every 10 seconds
and publishes the results to our Pub/Sub topic.
Open a new terminal window.
In this window, we'll have to reactivate our virtualenv
with source venv/bin/activate
and go back into our working directory.
In the editor, create a new file called bored.py.
We'll import the Google Pub/Sub Client Library
and also the Python libraries for HTTP requests and time.
We'll just hard code our project name and topic name here.
Don't forget to put your own project name and not mine.
Then we'll specify an API to call.
In this case, it's the public bored API,
which can suggest interesting things to do if you're bored.
Then we create a new instance of the publisher client
and set up our topic path.
Inside a while loop, we make a request to this API
and retrieve the text of their response.
Then, we call the published method on our publisher client,
sending it the topic and the data of the message,
which must be UTF 8 encoded.
Then, we just set the loop to sleep for 10 seconds
before doing this all over again.
Save the file, then going back into our terminal,
we'll just clear the screen again
and start the script running with Python api.py.
If we switch back to our listening terminal window,
we can see an inspired idea for what to do in our free time.
As we continue to watch,
a new message will be pulled from our subscription,
pretty much as soon as one is published to the topic
by our bored script.
Great job Cloud Gurus!
Let's hit Ctrl+C in both terminal windows
to stop the running processes.
Now to clean up, all we need to do
is delete our topic and subscription.
We can do this with gcloud pubsub subscriptions
delete LabSub,
and gcloud pubsub topics delete LabTopic,
and we're all done.
If you have any questions about this lab,
please feel free to ask me in the course forums.
If not, I'll see you in the next video.
