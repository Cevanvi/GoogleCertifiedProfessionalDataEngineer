Hey Cloud Gurus.
Welcome back.
This chapter is really an extension
of the chapter on machine learning.
We'll be covering the topic of deep learning in more detail.
Neural networks are the structures that allow us
to perform deep learning.
As is the case with most topics we look at.
Deep learning is well, deep.
It's possible to pursue a PhD in various aspects
of deep learning.
I'll be providing an overview of the topic here,
but hopefully it'll provide a foundation
for you to go on and learn more.
I should point out that it's certainly possible for you
to build and train your own deep learning models
that can be used to solve real-world problems.
At the end of this chapter, you'll be able to do just that.
We'll cover TensorFlow at an introductory level.
We'll also look at Keras,
which makes working with TensorFlow far easier.
In this first video,
we'll take a look at some of the foundational tools
that are super helpful in learning about
and doing deep learning.
Let's jump in.
Let's start with TensorFlow.
TensorFlow is Google's open source,
end to end machine learning framework.
TensorFlow can be used to create many different types
of machine learning models.
But it's especially powerful when working
with neural networks.
It was developed by the Google brain team, and it allows you
to build state of the art machine learning applications.
TensorFlow is compatible with a wide range
of hardware and devices.
TensorFlow models can be trained
and deployed across a wide range of hardware,
including CPUs, GPUs, and TPUs.
Single machines or clusters of machines
can be used for training TensorFlow models.
There is TensorFlow Lite,
which is specifically for deploying models
to mobile and embedded devices.
TensorFlow.js is a JavaScript library for training
and deploying models in the browser and on node.js.
TensorFlow extended is an end-to-end platform
for deploying machine learning pipelines.
TensorFlow extended can be used
to manage machine learning pipelines
throughout their entire lifecycle.
Now let's consider Keras.
Keras is an open source neural network library,
which is written in Python.
It runs on top of other machine learning frameworks,
such as TensorFlow, Microsoft's cognitive toolkit
and Theano.
Keras is a high level API,
which facilitates fast experimentation.
Keras was designed to facilitate fast experimentation
with deep neural networks.
It is easy to use. It is modular and it's extensible.
Keras was designed to be an interface rather
than a standalone machine learning framework.
Keras can be used in conjunction with CPUs and GPUs.
In 2017 Google's TensorFlow team decided
to support Keras in Tensor Flow's core library.
TensorFlow Keras is TensorFlow's implementation
of the Keras API specification.
TensorFlow Keras is a high-level API to build
and train models that include first-class support
for TensorFlow specific functionality.
TensorFlow Keras makes TensorFlow easier to use
without sacrificing some of the flexibility
and performance that is afforded by TensorFlow.
Let's quickly visualize the relationship
between TensorFlow and Keras.
We'd have a program written in say, Python,
our program will interact with the Keras API.
The Keras API will in turn interact
with the TensorFlow library.
There is always the option to use aspects
of the TensorFlow library directly in the program
without using the Keras API.
Let's now look at Jupyter.
Many of you may already be familiar with Jupyter notebooks.
Jupyter notebooks are an open source web application.
They're a great interactive way to run code in the browser.
Jupyter notebooks are also a great way to share code.
Jupyter supports 40 programming languages,
including R, Python, and Scala.
Jupyter notebooks can be used for data cleansing,
statistical modeling, as well as machine learning.
JupyterLab is a web based interactive
development environment for Jupyter notebooks, code,
as well as for data.
JupyterLab provides a number of workflows
in data science, scientific computing, and machine learning.
JupyterHub is a great way
to manage centralized deployments.
JupyterHub allows you to deploy Jupyter notebooks
to users within your organization.
JupyterHub is container friendly.
This means you can use Docker or Kubernetes
to scale your deployments.
Google CoLab is a new tool that will make
your machine learning experience so much easier.
It is a free cloud service based on Jupyter notebooks
for machine learning, education, and research.
It basically allows you to easily work
with Jupyter notebooks within Google Docs.
Google CoLab provides free GPU support.
It supports certain BASH commands.
It allows you to easily import data
and store that data in familiar folder structures
so that it makes it easy to work with that data.
It includes, preinstalled, all the major Python libraries,
such as TensorFlow, Scikit learn, and Matplotlib.
There'll be a link to a good Google CoLab video
in the resources.
Okay, Cloud Gurus.
I hope you found this video interesting,
and that you will take time to investigate some
of the tools I've mentioned in more detail.
Check out the resources section for more information.
See you in the next video.
