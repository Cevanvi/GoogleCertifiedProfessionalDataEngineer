Hello, Cloud Gurus.
In this chapter, we'll be exploring
the security of data
and how it can be regulated in certain industries.
These are important considerations
to make sure you keep your data and your job safe.
But why is security so important?
Can't we just ask nicely that nobody peeks
at anything they're not supposed to?
That nobody acts outside of the constraints
of what they should be doing?
Can't we all just get along?
Well, of course we can't.
This is the internet.
But seriously, data is valuable,
extremely valuable.
Data, as we know, is what powers businesses
and drives markets.
It defines our social groups.
It feeds into sales models.
And it affects how organizations interact with us.
So sadly, there will always be bad actors
who will try to steal data
and we have to do everything in our power
to safeguard it.
Not only is it extremely important to safeguard data,
it's often a requirement of some very strict laws.
Mishandling data can lead not just
to a massive embarrassment for a company,
but to huge fines and losses as well.
So, now that I finished scaring you,
let's talk about what we can do about security.
Thankfully, GCP has a huge pallet of products,
services, frameworks, and policies
to help you to keep data secure.
Starting with their own data centers,
GCP has the most stringent physical security
in the business, with everything from biometrics
to laser beam intrusion detection.
Fewer than 1% of Googlers
will even have set foot in a GCP data center
they're so closely guarded.
Moving onto physical computers,
Google has designed and built their own service
featuring a special custom security chip called Titan,
which verifies the servers' firmware
and software components.
Data that is stored on GCP servers is encrypted.
In fact, data is almost always encrypted
in flight or at rest inside GCP,
with a few minor exceptions.
Moving up the stack again,
we come to the operating system and software layer,
and here it's important to bear in mind
that this is a shared responsibility model.
GCP provides a rock solid platform security features
with security a core design and development requirements
of every product and service.
Then you have the Google information security team,
whose job it is to maintain Google network defenses,
build security infrastructure,
and implement security policies.
These are the brave women and men
who fend off thousands of attacks
on Google's network every day.
But it is up to us as users and operators
to take advantage of these features.
The operating systems and software we install,
the services we configure,
it's up to us to have a solid security design
for our systems,
to follow best practices,
and not leave any doors open to bad actors.
There are a couple of mantras to remember
that will help you accomplish this.
The first is the principle of least privilege.
We've seen this implemented in previous chapters,
where we created service accounts
with specific roles or permissions
to be utilized by individual applications.
Using service accounts allows you to take
human passwords and human error
out of the equation,
and being granular about security
also gives you a smaller blast radius
if something does go wrong.
The second mantra is "always be watching."
Watch your system logs, use audit logging,
and take advantage of tools
like cloud security command center
and event threat detection.
More on those later in the chapter.
You can't just walk away from a system
assuming it's secure
once you've set it up.
This covers data security quite nicely,
but it's important to remember the objective
of data privacy as well.
It's a related, but slightly different concept.
Consider the records
of a health insurance company, for example.
We can assume that data stored by this company
is considered secure
if it's in an encrypted state
and access to the data is restricted and audited,
but that doesn't necessarily mean
that this data is private.
Perhaps a system can be accessed by an authorized user,
but should they be allowed to access all of the data
contained in that system
or just specific files?
If they are dealing with someone's medical records,
might they accidentally have access
to the records of that person's family,
should some data be obfuscated
or anonymized for privacy reasons?
Could there in fact be a legal requirement
to do so in certain cases?
As you can see, you need a unified approach
to both security and privacy.
Finally, as I mentioned before,
there may be serious consequences
to an organization if it fails to ensure
a certain standard of security, privacy or both.
Depending on your industry or geographical location,
there may be strict laws regarding, for example,
health data or data for services
aimed at children under the age of 13.
Data breaches can lead to a loss of customer loyalty,
which will affect an organization's bottom line,
but they can also lead to huge fines
from the regulators.
In February 2019, the makers of TikTok
were fined $5.7 million by the FTC
for failing to comply with the children's
online privacy protection act in the U.S.
And in September 2019,
the FTC issued a fine under the same legislation
of $170 million to YouTube
for tracking users under 13
to facilitate targeted advertising.
We'll cover the major legislation
you need to be aware of later in this chapter.
Okay, Cloud Gurus,
before I slip into more fear-mongering,
let's move on to the next video,
where we'll start looking at some practical steps
you can take to keep your data safe.
