Hello, Cloud Gurus.
In this video,
we'll quickly revisit the concept of data privacy
and why it's a slightly different,
but related concept to data security.
As we saw in our overview video,
data security by itself might not be enough
for your application or organization.
You can follow all of the GCP best practices
and have a project built like Fort Knox,
but this still won't affect some fundamental things
about the data that you're storing
no matter how securely you're storing it.
Think about what is this data, not at a high level,
but exactly what information is being stored.
Should you even be storing it?
Who can access this data once they're authenticated?
Understanding these concepts
will help you keep data private as well as secure.
Let's start with, who can access the data?
You might be thinking, well, I've already covered this.
I'm using VPC Service Controls, Cloud KMS,
and service accounts,
and only my top level super admins can access the data.
And that's great,
but we're still in the realm of authentication here.
We can authenticate these people
using all of these wonderful security services
so we know they are legitimate users.
But what about authorization? That's slightly different.
My database administrator can absolutely authenticate
to the SQL database in my project,
but does that mean she should be authorized
to view all the data?
What if that data is sensitive?
It could be health records, credit checks,
even criminal records, or many more types of sensitive data.
Our DBA should certainly not be authorized
to view everything.
This is a design consideration
you really need to think about as a data engineer.
Perhaps access to the database should be isolated
to just the application service account
and the application itself should have a built-in system
of authorization levels and audit logging.
It's a complex design problem
that will depend on your application.
For this certification,
it's just a consideration you need to be aware of.
Related to this, we come back to our other concepts.
What is this data and should we be storing all of it?
In some large data processing tasks,
we may be ingesting huge amounts of data,
perhaps to perform some analytics or to create an ML model.
In all of that data, there might be plenty of stuff
we don't actually need to complete our task.
There might also be stuff we definitely don't want
because it's too risky to store it,
or we're not actually allowed to store it
due to some industry regulation.
More on that in the next video.
This sort of data is often referred to as PII
or Personally Identifiable Information.
It means any data that can be used
to identify a specific individual.
Thankfully, Google provides us with an excellent tool
to help called the Cloud Data Loss Prevention or DLP API.
This is an API we can use in our data pipelines
to perform different actions
to help remove or obfuscate PII data.
It can redact or remove identifiable
or sensitive data in text.
And not just text, it can also redact or remove identifiable
or sensitive data in images.
The DLP can provide pseudo-anonymization
by replacing PII data with similarly formatted dummy data.
And it can provide a risk analysis of data
to find properties that may increase the risk
of subjects being identified.
For example, it would recognize data like phone numbers,
credit card numbers, or social security numbers.
It's an extremely handy tool that will help you maintain
the privacy of any data you store.
The only downside to the DLP API
is that it can become expensive
when you start piping large amounts of data through it.
I've linked to the pricing page with examples
in the resources section.
Okay, Cloud Gurus, hopefully by now,
you have a grasp on these concepts
that will help you keep data private as well as secure.
Please let me know if you have any questions
about this video in the course forums.
I'll see you in the next video.
