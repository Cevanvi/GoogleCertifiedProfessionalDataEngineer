Hello, Cloud Gurus.
As we've said, GCP provides you with many tools
to help you ensure data security.
Let's take a closer look at some of them in this video.
Probably one of the most compelling reasons
to use GCP to secure your data
is that it offers encryption in flight and at rest
for all of your data, with just a few minor exceptions.
That means when your data is stored on a GCP virtual disk
within a GCP product or in cloud storage,
it's automatically encrypted using fully-managed
and frequently rotated keys.
And you can optionally choose
to supply your own encryption keys
if you don't fully trust Google to do this for you.
Even better, when data is in flight,
that means when it's being communicated
from one GCP endpoint to another, it is always encrypted.
This reduces the chances of any third party
being able to spy on data in-transit.
Because even if they did,
say perhaps by compromising a VM in your project
and running TCP dump,
all they would see is random zeros and ones
because they'd lack the decryption keys required
to make any sense of it.
If you do want to use your own keys,
you can use Google's Cloud Key Management Service or KMS.
This is a complete service
for creating and managing encryption keys in the cloud
using a number of different
industry standard cryptographic formats.
Keys can be grouped together into key rings
and used to provide storage encryption
for multiple GCP services
or simply to encrypt arbitrary data using the KMS API.
KMS can be given policies for the rotation of keys
and access to keys and key rings
can be fully controlled via Cloud IAM.
A lot of precautions we take when considering data security
are concerned with limiting any potential blast radius.
That's why we use the principle of least privilege
for our services and applications.
There's also the more traditional protection provided
by the use of good firewall rules,
but you can now also add a VPC layer of protection
using VPC service controls.
These allow you to define a security perimeter
around resources inside a VPC.
For example, if you have a collection of VMs within a VPC,
you can use VPC Service Controls
to define a security perimeter
that includes the GCP services that should remain private.
In other words,
those services that should only be used by these VMs.
This could be a Cloud Storage Bucket
or a Cloud SQL Database.
About 2/3 of the total GCP catalog
are currently supported for service controls.
So in this configuration,
our private VMs can contact these services,
but VMs outside of this VPC cannot.
Additionally, our VMs can't access any other services
unless we put them inside the perimeter.
If there are some exceptions to this configuration,
and if you really need to,
you can optionally select specific IP address ranges
that may cross your security perimeter
and access the private resources.
Finally, a great GCP service to familiarize yourself with
is the Security Command Center.
This is part of the GCP console
that combines various security services
into a single system.
It provides some great security insights,
including asset management features
so you can view and monitor
a complete inventory of your projects,
including reviewing your storage for sensitive data
and checking access rights across your organization.
A web security scanner
that can detect common vulnerabilities in web applications
running on App Engine, Compute Engine, or GKE.
Anomaly detection that detects potential changes
and external behavior of your resources
that may indicate a security compromise.
And threat detection that detects potential changes
in the internal behavior of your resources,
such as brute force SSH attacks and Cloud IAM abuse.
It can even detect certain phishing and malware behaviors
from VPC and other log data.
Once again, Cloud Gurus,
a working knowledge of these security products
should be enough to get you through the exam.
You don't need to have battle scars
or war stories from the field of internet battle.
For your own projects,
I definitely recommend you check out
the Security Command Center Quick Start
which I'll link to in the resources section.
Thanks for watching and I'll see you in the next video.
