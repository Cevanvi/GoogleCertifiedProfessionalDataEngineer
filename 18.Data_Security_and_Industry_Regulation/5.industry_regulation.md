Hello, Cloud Gurus.
To wrap up this chapter,
let's look at some of the industry regulations
that may affect your organization.
This is going to be a high-level overview,
as you only need an awareness of these laws for the exam.
They are also subject to change, and may not even apply
in your geographic region
or place in the space time continuum.
I am not a lawyer.
The first thing to know
is that if there is a compliance certification,
that a cloud provider can get, Google probably has it.
Check out the compliance resource center,
in the resources section of this video,
and you'll find the list of over 40 certifications,
attestations, reports, laws, regulations, alignments,
and frameworks that Google have signed up for, for GCP.
We'll look at just a handful of these in this video,
the ones that have a reasonable chance
of popping up in the exam.
3 of these are managed by authorities in the USA
and one is from the European Union,
but even if you don't live in these places
your users or customers might,
so you still need to be aware of their implications.
Let's start with FedRAMP,
or the Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program.
This is a set of guidelines devised by several
US government authorities,
including the Departments of Defense and Homeland Security.
And it sets standards for how data is handled
and stored securely by cloud vendors.
There are different levels of FedRAMP compliance,
and GCP has the highest level of compliance,
called provisional authority by the program,
for 17 of its products in 5 regions,
including most of its most popular services.
64 of its products, in 17 regions,
then meet the moderate authority level.
I'll put the full list, for your enjoyment,
in the resources section.
Now, what does this mean for you as a data engineer?
FedRAMP is a stringent standard,
so it should give you confidence in the way Google
is handling security internally,
but if your organization is dealing
with any US federal agencies it will also be mandatory
that your chosen cloud vendor has this accreditation.
Moving on, let's look at
the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act, or COPPA,
a US regulation applicable to the collection
of PII data from children under the age of 13.
This is another regulation where even if you're not based
in the US your users might be,
and depending on the nature of your application or service
you might find under 13 year olds using it.
As I mentioned in the overview, this is what has cost
TikTok and YouTube millions of dollars in fines.
If this law does apply to you, then it's not optional.
The primary goal of COPPA is to place parents
in control of data collection
if their children are accessing online services.
You must have a clear privacy policy.
Incorporate parental consent into your service,
and take many further steps to maintain the confidentiality,
security, and integrity of the data you are collecting.
You can't simply mine kids data
because it helps build advertising models,
you need a valid reason to store
and use every piece of data you might collect.
For those parents out there, you may have received
the occasional parental consent email every time your kid
downloads a new game on their iPad, COPPA is why.
Next up it's the Health Insurance Portability
and Accountability Act, or HIPAA.
This US law is designed to provide data security
and privacy related to personal health information,
which, as you can imagine, is big business in the US.
GCP is certified HIPAA compliant
across the majority of its product range and in all regions.
However, to extend that certification to your use of GCP,
your organization will be required to review and accept
a HIPAA Business Associate Agreement, or BAA, with Google.
And, in order to agree to that,
you have to meet several other standards as well.
Look, we've got to keep lawyers in a job haven't we?
PCI DSS is the Payment Card Industries
Data Security Standards certification.
GCP gets reviewed by an independent
quality security assessor and has PCI DSS 3.2 compliance
for specific GCP products and services.
In plain English this means that GCP, as a platform,
has been rated as secure enough
for services or applications which store, process,
or transmit cardholder data.
However, it is entirely the responsibility
of the application owner, that's you,
to make sure your application is also PCI DSS compliant.
Once again, Google give you the right tools,
but you have to know how to use them,
it doesn't just happen by magic.
And, finally, my personal favorite, GDPR,
or the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation.
This is a massive comprehensive privacy framework
designed to protect the personal data of European citizens,
and has far reaching requirements and constraints
on the use, storage, retention, and transfer of PII data.
And it applies to any entity in the world that interacts
with any data belonging to any EU citizen,
which is why it is responsible for so many pop-ups
and cookie preferences pages across the web.
Joking aside, though, it does actually contain
some really valuable privacy protection for us lowly humans.
It took years to get it into law,
and it's kind of sad that people are so quick to dismiss
the protection it offers,
like a nagging newsletter sign-up pop-up ad.
Okay Cloud Gurus, like I said,
you just need to know the names of these regulations
and briefly where they would apply.
And that about wraps it up for this chapter.
If you have any questions please let me know
in the course forum, and, if not, I'll see you next time.
