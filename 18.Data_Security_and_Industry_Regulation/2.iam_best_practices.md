Hello, Cloud Gurus.
We've touched on identity and access management,
or IAM, a few times throughout this course
in the context of various GCP products and services.
In this video, we'll summarize some best practices for IAM,
so that you're always using GCP in a secure way.
Before we start,
let's just take a moment to thank the inventor of IAM.
The American rapper, singer, songwriter, record producer,
DJ, television personality,
and founding member of the black eyed peas Mr. Will.I.Am.

Okay, so as we learned in the last video,
Google gives you everything you need to
operate in a secure way. But,
it's up to us data engineers to leverage the tools properly.
This means using IAM securely.
Let's go over my favorite security mantra, again,
The principle of least privilege.
When you grant a role in IAM
it's tempting to just use a primitive role,
such as roles editor.
This is certainly going to make sure that your application
has complete access to everything it needs,
but that's too much access.
If it gets compromised, your blast radius
is your entire project.
Instead, use predefined roles,
specific to each GCP product or service.
You should also treat every component of your stack
as a separate trust boundary.
A trust boundary can be visualized
as the perimeter within which your application
can access services.
Outside of that boundary, access should be denied.
If you have multiple components, applications,
or microservices in your stack,
each should have its own boundary.
Then, each should be assigned only the permissions it needs.
Again, according to the principle of least privilege.
Let's look at another example of this.
Say we have a microservice,
whose only function is to publish messages
to a specific pub/sub topic.
You can use the predefined role for message publisher
that can be isolated to a single topic,
and then bind this role to a service account
used by the application.
The microservice has precisely the permissions
it needs to operate and nothing more.
If it gets compromised, somehow,
it still won't be allowed to access any other resources
in the project.
In GCP,
there is a hierarchy for resources.
At the very top is the organization layer.
Under this, you have folders,
which are logical containers for projects,
or alternatively, projects may exist outside of any folder.
Folders should typically belong to a department or team
within an organization.
Then we have the projects themselves,
which are typically grouped around specific applications
in specific environments.
And inside projects, you have their individual resources.
Wherever possible, this GCP hierarchy
should be designed to match the actual layout
of your real life organization.
IAM policies follow this hierarchy,
and propagate down the structure.
This means that policies applied to a parent object
will be inherited by a child object.
In fact, the policy applied to the child object
will be a union of any inherited policies.
Plus, any policies
specifically applied to that child object.
A quick note on granting roles to users.
It's best practice to use groups in G-suite,
or Cloud Identity, and grant roles to groups,
instead of individual users.
For example, you may have a network admins group
that contains some users.
This group can
then have the compute network admin role assigned to it.
So, all the users in that group inherit that policy.
If you need to adjust the permissions for the group,
you can do it all in one place.
Likewise, if someone's role changes,
you simply move them out of the group.
As a data engineer, you will generally deal more with
service accounts than human users.
As we discussed way back in chapter 3,
surface accounts are a special type of Google account,
designed to represent some non-human user of a service,
or API.
When you create a virtual machine in GCP,
it acts via a service account
that determines which services it is allowed to access.
Any programmatic access to Google APIs
from within an application
should also be achieved through a service account.
Service accounts are assigned IAM roles,
in just the same way as human accounts.
Human accounts have passwords, and hopefully,
multifactor authentication.
Service accounts have keys.
These can be downloaded in JSON format,
when a service account is created.
A key can be used by an application
to authenticate against Google APIs,
or certain GCP products like Compute VMs,
can automatically use a service account.
Treat keys as you do passwords,
and other super sensitive information.
If a JSON Key is leaked,
someone will be able to access
billable resources in your project.
Keys should be rotated where possible,
although,
how you do this is beyond the scope of this course.
And, thankfully, the exam.
Alternatively, you can
create short-lived credentials for your service accounts.
These are slightly more fiddly,
and require making programmatic requests to the IAM API.
You can then request an OAUTH, OPENID, or JWT token
that has a short lifespan,
say just 1 hour, rather than use a permanent key.
Be extra cautious of the service account user role.
This role allows a user, or another service account,
to impersonate an existing service account,
and take on all of its IAM policies.
If you do need a service
to impersonate another service account,
it's best to use short-lived credentials
for the impersonator.
As I said, most of this is beyond the scope of the exam, but
if you're looking to apply these policies in production,
you should definitely consider auditing your projects
using the Cloud IAM API.
You should check for service accounts with keys.
Have they been rotated?
Are they still required, and can they be deleted?
Check for user account roles.
Are they too permissive?
Can policies be more granular?
Okay, Cloud Gurus.
For now, just make yourself aware of the predefined roles
for each product and service,
and you should be all set for the exam.
And that wraps it up for IAM best practices.
If you have any questions,
please let me know in the course forums.
I'll see you in the next video.
