## Lesson Transcript
```text
Hello, Cloud Gurus,
and welcome to this video explaining demo lessons.
If you look through the course outline,
you'll probably notice that there are some lessons marked
as demo.
In these lessons, you might hear
the training architect refer to the lesson
as a lab, or the slides might say lab rather than demo.
At the time of recording this course,
a demonstration walkthrough lesson was referred to
as a hands-on lab.
But to eliminate confusion
with the hands-on lab feature we have on our platform,
these technical walkthroughs have been renamed as demos.
You are welcome to follow along with these demos,
but to really get the best hands-on experience and practice,
we encourage you to check out our hands-on labs offering.
These will be marked clearly in each course outline.
Thanks for taking the time to watch this video,
and keep being awesome, Cloud Gurus.
