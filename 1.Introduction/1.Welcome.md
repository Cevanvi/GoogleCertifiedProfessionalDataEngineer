Hello, Cloud Gurus.
My name is Tim Berry,
and I'm pleased to introduce you
to the certification course for the
Google Certified Professional Data Engineer Qualification.
I'm a Google Certified Professional Architect,
Data Engineer and Cloud Developer.
And I've worked as an engineer and developer
for over 20 years.
I've seen the use of big data skyrocket
in the last few years
and not just in the applications and industries,
you would normally think of.
Handling large volumes of data
for analytics or machine learning
are becoming more commonplace
in all kinds of workloads.
And companies are struggling with
how to handle this data without good data engineers.
So what is a data engineer
and why would someone want to take this course
and achieve this cert?
A data engineer's job is to build and manage infrastructure
and tooling for handling data.
That can be anything from large databases
to petabyte scale analytics datasets,
to data for training and testing machine learning models.
A data engineer needs to build pipelines
for ingesting data, systems that process and analyze data,
and frontends that can visualize and report data.
You also need to know how to build
and train your own Machine Learning models,
as well as leverage Google's prebuilt Machine Learning APIs.
This course covers everything you need to know
to become a competent data engineer and pass
the Google Certified Professional Data Engineer Exam,
a valuable and much coveted qualification.
We'll look at the entire GCP suite of big data products,
including Big Query, PubSub, Data Proc, Data Flow and more.
We'll also learn all about GCP's Machine Learning tools,
including AutoML and TensorFlow,
as well as other considerations of data engineering,
such as storage options, building data pipelines,
security, and compliance.
In each of these chapters I'll break down
what you need to know with concise lectures
followed by some hands-on labs to reinforce your learning,
gaining a comprehensive understanding
of these tools and systems
and earning yourself this certification
will make you a valuable individual in numerous industries
where data is now the most important currency.
You could find yourself analyzing retail and market trends,
crunching health sciences or educational data,
or even building models
to help deal with climate emergencies all over the world.
In this introduction chapter,
we'll have a brief overview of the course.
Then talk a bit more about the intended audience
and some prerequisites.
It's okay to have no formal experience
of these big data and ML tools,
but you should have some background with databases
at a minimum and have deployed
some basic infrastructure on GCP.
I'll make some recommendations
for further background learning
in the prerequisites video.
And just before we get started some quick housekeeping,
to follow along with the labs in this course,
you may have to create billable resources in GCP.
Wherever possible, I'll try to keep these things
in the free tier, but you can also sign up with GCP
and receive $300 in free credits to use.
And keep an eye on the resources section of each video,
where I'll put some helpful links and further reading.
Okay, we're ready to start.
Thanks again for joining me
and keep being awesome, Cloud Gurus.
