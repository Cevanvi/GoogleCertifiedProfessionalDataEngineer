Hello, Cloud Gurus.
Let's go through some quick exam tips for Bigtable.
The first tip is to know when to choose Bigtable.
As you'll find with lots of products and services
in the curriculum,
many exam questions will be based on just choosing the right
one for the workload.
If a case study refers to migrating from an on-premise
workload to Bigtable,
look out for mentions of Hbase.
Also look for when Bigtable beats BigQuery
due to the nature of the data.
This could be for time series data or large data sets
where latency is an issue.
My next tip is to understand the architecture of Bigtable.
The exam won't expect you
to be an advanced Bigtable administrator,
but you should understand the concepts of an instance
and a cluster where Bigtable stores data
and how tablets are rebalanced by the service between nodes.
And as part of that high-level understanding
you need to be aware of the common causes of bad performance
in a Bigtable instance,
such as under-resourced clusters, bad schema design,
and poorly chosen row keys.
Row keys, row keys, row keys.
This can't be overstated,
or maybe I just did overstate it.
Regardless, the linear scale and performance of Bigtable
really does depend on good row keys.
Make sure you have a solid understanding of row key design
as in the exam,
you may have to either choose an optimal row key
or point out the flaws in a bad one.
You should also understand the difference
between a wide table design and a tall table design
sometimes called a tall and narrow design.
Wide tables store multiple columns for a given row key
where the query pattern is likely to require
all the information about a single entity.
Even if that entity is stored across multiple rows.
Tall tables suit time-series, or graph data,
and often only contain a single column.
Finally, don't forget organizational design.
The exam may also ask you to consider
how a Bigtable instance is designed for the users
who will be developing their applications for it.
Consider when a development instance is appropriate.
And remember the IAM roles that can be used
to isolate access to the necessary groups.
Okay, that wraps up our chapter on Cloud Bigtable.
