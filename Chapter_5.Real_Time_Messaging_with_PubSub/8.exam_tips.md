Hello, Cloud Gurus.
Let's round off this chapter with some Pub/Sub exam tips.
First up, a couple of pointers to help you spot
where Pub/Sub would be a good architectural choice.
Think about where you can decouple data.
Try to spot where Pub/Sub would be a good fit
to decouple components that would normally send data
directly to each other.
Pub/Sub can be a shock absorber, receiving data globally
and allowing it to be consumed
by other components at their own pace.
In addition to handling data and messages,
think about where you can use Pub/Sub
for events to decouple services.
Try to spot where Pub/Sub can add event logic to a stack.
Pub/Sub can pass events from one system to another
using any of the patterns we have described
to create asynchronous workflows.
But as with any other product or service,
you should be aware of Pub/Sub's limitations.
Pub/Sub has unrivaled capacity and latency globally,
but it does have certain limitations.
Message data must be 10 megabytes or less in size
and you need to be mindful of the expiry time
of undelivered messages and unused subscriptions.
My next tip is to look for uses
of Apache Kafka in any case studies.
If Kafka comes up in the exam,
Pub/Sub may be a great cloud service to replace it with,
especially if a case study calls
for managed cloud services to be embraced.
But Kafka has a much broader feature set,
so make sure Pub/Sub still meets
the necessary technical requirements.
Then there's Google's Cloud Tasks.
We haven't looked at this relatively new service,
but you should familiarize yourself with it at a high level.
Cloud Tasks is designed for explicit invocation
by a publisher or controller as opposed
to Pub/Sub's decentralized approach.
Normally, in exam questions and case studies,
the preferred system is very clear.
And finally, browse the reference architectures
available on GCP's solutions website.
Pub/Sub is normally the glue that holds together
a data pipeline or other asynchronous workflow in a stack.
You can look at the smart analytics reference architectures
to see how Pub/Sub works
with other GCP products and services.
I'll put a link to these architectures
in the Resources section.
Okay, that wraps up our chapter on Cloud Pub/Sub.
Please feel free to reach out to me in the course forums
if you have any questions,
and if not, I'll see you next time.
Keep being awesome, Cloud Gurus.
