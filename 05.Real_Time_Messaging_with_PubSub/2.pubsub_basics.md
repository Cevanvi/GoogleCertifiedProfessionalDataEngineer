Hello Cloud Gurus,
and welcome to this lecture
where we'll cover the basics of Pub/Sub,
including publishing and receiving messages.
Depending on the workflow you need to achieve,
there are many different patterns
for implementing Pub/Sub messaging.
Let's take a look at each one.
We'll start with the one-to-one pattern,
where we have a publisher, a topic,
and a subscriber.
The publisher sends messages to the topic in Pub/Sub,
where they are queued, ready to be read,
and the subscriber receives the messages and reads them.
The subscriber accesses messages in a topic
via a subscription,
and you can have more than one subscription to a topic.
This is the one-to-many pattern.
The publisher sends messages to the topic,
and each subscriber receives a message
via their own subscription.
Note that each subscriber is guaranteed
to receive each message at least once.
That's because they each have their own subscription.
So in this case,
both subscribers get copies of the same messages.
If you wanted multiple subscribers
to get only their own messages from the same subscription,
effectively round-robining the messages between subscribers,
you can just make them share a single subscription.
Now we move on to the many-to-many pattern,
which is really just like the one-to-one pattern,
except with multiple topics.
If these topics were only subscribed to
by a single subscriber,
we'd have the many-to-one pattern.
Which pattern you choose will all depend on your workload,
and the desired workflow you're trying to achieve.
Publishing messages to Pub/Sub is easy,
you just create a message containing your data,
this is going to be a JSON payload,
that's base64 encoded.
The total size of the payload
needs to be 10MB or less.
Then you send the payload as a request to the Pub/Sub API
specifying the topic
to which the message should be published.
Receiving messages is just as easy.
You simply create a subscription to a topic.
Subscriptions are always associated with a single topic.
There are 2 types of delivery method for subscriptions.
Pull is the default method.
When you have created a pull subscription,
you can make ad hoc pull requests to the Pub/Sub API,
specifying your subscription to receive messages
associated to that subscription.
When you receive a message,
note that you have to acknowledge
that you've received it.
If you don't, that message will remain
at the top of the queue associated with your subscription,
and you won't get the next message,
or any messages after that,
until you've acknowledged it.
Alternatively, you can configure a push subscription,
which will automatically send new messages to an endpoint
that you define.
The endpoint must use the HTTPS protocol
with a valid SSL certificate.
And of course,
something has to sit on the end of that endpoint
that is capable of receiving and processing a message.
Pub/Sub uses a slow start algorithm
to moderate the speed of messages sent to push endpoints.
It will gradually increase in speed,
but back off again if it receives any connection problems.
It expects a valid HTTP code to acknowledge a message
before it'll move on to the next one.
Pub/Sub integrates nicely with pretty much
everything in GCP,
and there are client libraries
for all popular programming languages:
Python, C#, Go, Java, Node, PHP, and Ruby.
Pub/Sub is fully supported by Cloud DataFlow,
allowing you to use the Apache Beam SDK
to read messages, and window,
or buffer them into batches.
DataFlow is covered in more detail
in another chapter in this course.
You can use events in Pub/Sub topics
to trigger the invocation of Cloud Functions,
or use Cloud Run to be the receiver of a push subscription.
Pub/Sub is also the foundation of Cloud IoT Core,
receiving the messages and events
from connected devices that can then be consumed
by any other GCP service for later processing.
If you're developing applications locally
that will leverage Pub/Sub,
but you don't want to use live topics,
or risk running up charges,
there is also a local Pub/Sub emulator available.
To run this, you just need the Google Cloud SDK,
and a Java Runtime Environment, version 7 or above.
You can then run the emulator as a local Pub/Sub service.
Well that about covers the basics, Cloud Gurus.
I'll see you in the next video.
